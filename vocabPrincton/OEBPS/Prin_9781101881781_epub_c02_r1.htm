<h1 class="chap_title">Strategies for Learning New Words</h1>
<h2 class="section_brk"><a id="page16"/>Three Kinds of Words</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Before we discuss specific strategies for learning vocabulary, we need to talk about how you know which words you already know. Sounds a little weird, doesn’t it? You may think it’s like a light switch with only two positions: You either know a word or you don’t. However, your vocabulary is actually divided into three categories: words you know, words you sort of know, and words you’ve never heard of.</p>
<p class="extract">The best way to figure out which category a word belongs in is to imagine yourself walking down the street when a small spaceship lands in front of you. An alien emerges to greet you. Since we’ve already got you imagining a close encounter, it shouldn’t be too much of a stretch to imagine that the alien starts asking you for help defining words. The first word it asks you to define is <em>apple</em>. You respond by saying, “An apple is a type of fruit that grows on a tree, has an edible skin and a core with seeds in it, and is usually green, red, or yellow.” <em>Apple</em> is therefore a word you know, because it’s one for which you can provide a dictionary definition. The next word the alien asks about is on the opposite end of the spectrum—<em>acarpous</em>, for instance. For all you know, this might be a word in Alienese; it falls into the “Huh?” category of words you don’t know at all. Finally, the alien, whom you’ve grown somewhat fond of by now, asks you to define <em>integrity</em>. This is probably a word you’ve seen many times and used yourself, but how do you define it for your new friend? If you use examples or a story to explain integrity, it falls into the category of words you sort of know.</p>
<p class="extract">It is easy to see why you need to learn the words you don’t know at all that are likely to appear on the GRE. It might be a little less obvious why the “sort of” words are important, but it is every bit as critical to recognize these and learn their dictionary definitions. Although it might seem fine to skip over these words since you already sort of know them, you must be able to define them clearly in order to <a id="page17"/>deal with them effectively on the test. If you are ever unsure about whether a word is one that you “sort of” or “definitely” know, try defining it for your alien visitor. You can also use the warm-up tests in the next chapter to help you identify some of your “sort of” words and make sure they go onto flashcards. The good news is that those “sort of” words are typically easier to learn than the “Huh?” words, because you already have a head start!</p>
<p class="extract">There may also be words in this book you are sure you know, but that have secondary definitions ETS loves to try to trick you with. Always check your definition against the ones included here. Often these secondary definitions involve a change in a word’s part of speech. For example, you probably know “color” as a noun, but do you know what it means as a verb? (It’s in <a class="hlink" href="Prin_9781101881781_epub_c04_r1.htm">Chapter 4</a> if you don’t.)</p>
<h2 class="section">Techniques and Tools</h2>
<p class="nonindent">There are many approaches to learning new vocabulary. The right way is the way that works for you. Generally, this is going to involve a combination of techniques and tools, a number of which we explain in this chapter. One of the advantages you have over that younger version of yourself that took the SAT or ACT is that now you know more about how you learn best. Are you a visual learner? Do you learn most effectively by doing? Do you have an easier time remembering things you hear or things you read? The key is to use the strategies that mesh best with your optimal learning style. When in doubt, try a variety of approaches to see what works.</p>
<p class="extract">Again, whichever tools you end up using, you will find they work best in combination. Our brains seem to develop different pathways for remembering things based on how we receive information. Writing a word and its definition is likely to reinforce the memory of reading it. Saying the definition out loud can augment the memorizing you did when you heard it said. The most effective program of study will be one that consistently uses reading, writing, listening, and speaking to memorize words.</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="page18"/>One other key component to a successful program, which shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, is being able to follow it. The best-laid plan that you promptly ignore won’t do you any good at all. Make sure your program is realistic and then follow it.</p>
<h3 class="section">Flashcards</h3>
<p class="nonindent">They may not seem very “hi-tech” or glamorous, but using flashcards is still one of your best techniques for learning vocabulary. Not all flashcards are equally effective, however. First, you want to ensure that your cards are portable. Did you notice the size of this book? We designed it to be compact so that you can slip it into your backpack or briefcase and carry it with you. Flashcards need to be even easier to carry around with you. Take 3 × 5 index cards and cut them in half. Write one vocab word on the front and its definition on the back. On the back of the card, you should include at least one of the mnemonic devices outlined in the next section. More than one device per card is even better.</p>
<p class="extract">You need to make your flashcards compact, because cramming doesn’t work for studying vocabulary. Staring at a list of words for an hour at a time isn’t at all efficient or effective, and it’s certainly not much fun. Instead, the key is to work with a group of words for brief periods—ten minutes or so—several times a day. This does two things for you. First, it uses your brain’s memorization processes most effectively. Second, it makes it possible to study vocabulary for a significant amount of time each day without requiring major schedule changes. Count up all the times in a day that you wait around for something for at least five minutes. Commit to reviewing your flashcards that many times per day. Here’s a sample of what your flashcard review schedule might look like:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">On bus/train to work</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">During morning coffee break</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">At lunch</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;"><a id="page19"/>On bus/train home</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Waiting for dinner to finish cooking</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Right before bed</li>
</ul>
<p class="extract">If you muted the TV during commercials, you’d have at least 15 minutes to review your cards every hour, and all you’d be sacrificing is commercial watching. Doesn’t sound too painful, does it? The trick with all this is to make sure you have your cards with you all the time. Unexpected wait at the doctor’s office? Golden opportunity for learning some vocabulary, as long as you have your flashcards with you.</p>
<p class="extract">Make a specific plan for the number of new words you will learn each week and make new cards as you go. Be sure to periodically cycle earlier words back into the stack of cards you carry with you, so you don’t forget the ones you’ve already learned.</p>
<h3 class="section">Mnemonic Devices</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Mnemonic devices are things that help you remember something. They work by creating a link in your memory between a word and its definition <em>through</em> another associated image, phrase, or sound (or smell for that matter, but we don’t have any good examples for those). When you come up with a mnemonic tool, you are helping your brain by working with or creating associations that make it easier for you to remember a definition.</p>
<p class="extract">There are very few rules when it comes to good mnemonics. In fact, there’s only one that really matters: If it works, it’s good. Look at a word and its definition. Is there anything about either one that makes you think of something else? Reminds you of something or someone? If so, is there a way you can connect that association with the word and its definition? Let’s take a simple example for the word <em>fallow</em>. If you looked at the definition for the word (<em>untilled, inactive, dormant</em>) and the first thing that popped into your head <a id="page20"/>was a picture of your brother Fred, who’s been out of work for the last six months and has spent that time lying on the couch, then you could use that image as a mnemonic device. The initial F in each word, Fred and <em>fallow</em>, links the two, and you associate Fred with inactivity, which reminds you that fallow means inactive and dormant. You do have to be careful here to distinguish between the association as a tool to remember the definition, and the definition itself, since idiomatic usage dictates that <em>fallow</em> is not usually used to describe people, though it can be used to describe parts of people (such as their minds).</p>
<p class="extract">While this example used an association from personal life, some mnemonics rely primarily on similar sounds and (often crazy) images to create associations. To come up with these, try to find a part or parts of the word that look or sound like other words that can lead you to the correct definition of the original. The connecting words should create specific, detailed images in your mind that have associations with the definition you are looking for. The sillier the images, the better they work! Here are some examples:</p>

</tr>
</table>
<p class="extract"><a id="page21"/>Mnemonics don’t work unless you use them, so practice! Don’t forget to write them down on your flashcards as well. It’s not always easy to come up with good ones right away, but if you keep trying it gets easier. If nothing else, you will probably have memorized the word in the process of trying to come up with a mnemonic device for it. In the end, any association that gets you to the correct definition is good, so feel free to use anything that works: songs, your friends’ less endearing qualities, characters in books, anything at all!</p>
<h3 class="section">Use Them</h3>
<p class="nonindent">All vocabulary stays abstract until you use it in real life. As we discussed with the writing sample portion of the GRE, context matters. It not only helps you remember words, but putting words in context also helps you become comfortable with their idiomatic usage. As you learn new words, try them out in conversation and writing. It is really no different from learning a foreign language; practice and immersion work best.</p>
<h3 class="section">Test Yourself</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Periodically testing how well you have learned new words will keep you on track and point out any gaps in what you know. <a class="hlink" href="Prin_9781101881781_epub_c03_r1.htm">Chapter 3</a> has a series of warm-up tests to use as a means of assessing your starting level. You can also use these warm-up tests, as well as the short quizzes that appear after every 10 or 15 words in <a class="hlink" href="Prin_9781101881781_epub_c04_r1.htm">Chapter 4</a>, and the final exam at the end of the book to check your progress as you go. Get other people to quiz you as well. All you need to do is hand your flashcards over to friends and have them ask you a series of words as they flip through the stack. If at all possible, set up a regular schedule. Can you get your significant other to quiz you at dinner? What about your co-workers on your lunch break? If you treat it as fun, other people will want to join in. Remember how Tom Sawyer got everyone else to whitewash the fence for him by acting as if it were a treat instead of a chore? Use the same principle and <a id="page22"/>make your flashcards the centerpiece while hanging out with your friends. Everyone will want to see how many words they know, and you get practice while dazzling everyone with how many <em>you</em> know.</p>
<h3 class="section">Roots</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Learning common word roots will help you remember the definitions of words that contain them, because they act like instant mnemonics. Some students find it very effective to simultaneously learn and memorize words that share common roots. In <a class="hlink" href="Prin_9781101881781_epub_c05_r1.htm">Chapter 5</a>, we’ve included a list of the roots that most often show up in GRE words. This is a great place to start your detective work.</p>
<h3 class="section">Games</h3>
<p class="nonindent">We’ve saved the best for last. Playing vocab games combines many of the best techniques for learning words. Here are some examples of games, but you should also be creative and come up with some of your own. These games are designed so that you can play them by yourself, but getting others to play along will only increase the games’ effectiveness.</p>
<h4 class="section">Creative Writing</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Choose ten words at random and write a brief story using all of them. Try to have the story make as much sense as possible, but silly is fine! Once you get the hang of it, give yourself a time limit (15 minutes or so).</p>
<h4 class="section"><a id="page23"/>The Name Game</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pick 40 or 50 adjectives at random from the list of words in <a class="hlink" href="Prin_9781101881781_epub_c04_r1.htm">Chapter 4</a>. Now write down the names of 10 friends. Assign each adjective to one of your friends, based on their personalities. This is a great source of new mnemonics. Try the same thing with a list of 10 celebrities.</p>
<h4 class="section">Concentration</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pick 20 words and write each one on a blank index card (one word per card). Take another set of cards and write the definitions for the same 20 words on the new cards (one definition per card). You should now have 40 cards: 20 with words and 20 with definitions. The other side of each card should be blank. Shuffle the cards and lay them down on a table, making a rectangle four cards wide and ten cards long. (Depending on space, you could also make one five cards wide and eight cards long.) Turn over two cards. If you get a word and a definition and they match, remove the two cards. If they don’t match, or you get two words or two definitions, turn them both back over. Your goal is to remove all the cards in as few moves as possible by remembering where words and definitions are on the “board.” Keep track of how many moves you make before clearing the board. Try to improve your record each time.</p>
<h4 class="section">Simple Yet Effective</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pick one word each day. Use it at some point that same day, in conversation, in an e-mail, wherever. If you get ambitious, go for two or even three in the same day.</p>
