<ul class="bullet">
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Vivian’s <em>ebullience</em> was contagious, which is what made her such a great tour guide; her infectious enthusiasm for her subject always communicated itself to her listeners.</li>

<ul class="bullet">
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">The big purple flower tied to the antenna of Felicia’s car is hardly a mark of <em>eccentricity</em>; it’s there so she can easily find her car in a parking lot.</li>

<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">It seemed a little silly for him to compose an <em>elegy</em> for his pet tadpole, especially since it hadn’t died, even if now it was a frog instead of the tadpole he once loved.</li>
</ul>
<p class="nonindent">It’s very easy to confuse <em>elegy</em> with <em>eulogy</em>, which is also in this book, but the two aren’t exactly the same.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>ELOQUENT</strong> (EL uh kwent) <em>adj</em> well-spoken; expressive; articulate</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">It was hard to believe English wasn’t her native language given her <em>eloquent</em> use of it.</li>
