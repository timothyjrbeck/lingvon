<h1 class="chap_title">Science Words</h1>
<p class="extract" style="page-break-before: always; padding-top: 1em;"><a id="page356"/>Even people who’ve put time and effort into improving their vocabulary tend to have a spotty knowledge of science terms; it’s hard to pick them up outside of bio or pre-med courses. So familiarize yourself with the following list and you may get more out of your next trip to the doctor—or, at least, your favorite TV medical drama. You’ll also spot a number of terms that have roots in common with other kinds of vocabulary words.</p>
<p class="extract">It is important to note here that highly specialized medical terminology is rarely tested on the GRE’s Sentence Equivalence or Text Completion question types. However, by knowing these types of words you will be able to understand more clearly many of the science passages that are found in the Reading Comprehension section. In this light, the science terms found in this chapter are very useful.</p>
<p class="extract">In this chapter, we’ve included several parts of words that people commonly confuse. See how many you can identify!</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>ADRENALINE</strong> (uh DREN uh lun) <em>n</em> a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, especially in conditions of stress; also called epinephrine</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Adrenaline</em> is often released by the body to prepare for fight or flight. Taking a test is an <em>adrenaline</em> trigger if it is a stressful situation. This leads to anxiety in some point and increased focus and stamina in others.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>ANTERIOR</strong> (an TEER err or) <em>adj</em> situated near the front of the body (opposite of posterior)</p>
<p class="extract">When a word starts with <em>ant</em>-, it usually means something that is before or in front. <em>Antebellum</em>, <em>ante</em> (in poker), and even <em>antlers</em> are some examples.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>AORTA</strong> (ay OR tah) <em>n</em> the main artery of the body, which supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page357"/><strong>ARTERY</strong> (AR tuh ree) <em>n</em> tube by which blood is carried from the heart to other parts of the body</p>
<p class="extract">In common speech, <em>arteries</em> can refer to waterways, highways, or basically anything by which something is carried from one place to another.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>ATROPHY</strong> (AT roh fee) <em>v</em> waste away, particularly because of disuse</p>
<p class="extract">In medicine and sports, <em>atrophy</em> is something that happens to muscles when they aren’t used, but the word can also refer figuratively to skills and abilities.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>AXON</strong> (AK sahn) <em>n</em> a projection of a nerve cell that sends electric stimulation to other nerve cells</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>BACTERIA</strong> (bak TEER ee uh) <em>n</em> a group of microscopic, one-celled microorganisms</p>
<p class="extract">While some bacteria can make us sick, there are many beneficial kinds as well, some of which we actually need in order for our bodies to function properly. The singular form of the word <em>bacteria</em> is <em>bacterium</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CALORIE</strong> (KAL or ee) <em>n</em> a unit of energy-producing potential that is contained in food.</p>
<p class="extract">The word <em>calorie</em>, when used in the context of food, actually refers to what scientists called a <em>kilocalorie</em>. A <em>kilocalorie</em> is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CAPILLARY</strong> (KAP uh ler ee) <em>n</em> any of the fine-branching blood vessels that form a network between the arteries and veins</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CARPAL</strong> (KAR pul) <em>adj</em> relating to the bones in the wrist</p>
<p class="extract">Carpal tunnel syndrome is one usage that might make this word familiar.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page358"/><strong>CARTILAGE</strong> (KAR tuh lej) <em>n</em> firm, whitish, flexible tissue that often connects bones</p>
<p class="extract">Babies are born with more <em>cartilage</em> than adult humans have, because it is replaced by bone as their skeletons become fully formed. Some creatures (such as sharks) maintain a high amount of <em>cartilage</em> throughout their lives.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CEREBRUM</strong> (sur EE brum) <em>adj</em> the largest part of the brain,, responsible for higher mental functions, such as thought, emotion, and memory</p>
<p class="extract">The <em>cerebrum</em> is divided into left and right hemispheres which are joined by the <em>corpus</em> <em>callosum</em>. When people or experiences are described as <em>cerebral</em>, <em>that</em> means they are characterized by deep or plentiful mental activity.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CONGENITAL</strong> (kun JEN uh tul) <em>adj</em> present from birth</p>
<p class="extract">While this word deals primarily with defects and other anatomical conditions in the field of medicine, it is used in ordinary English as a synonym for innate or inveterate; a <em>congenital</em> liar is someone who cannot break the habit of telling untruths.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CORTEX</strong> (KOR teks) <em>n</em> outer layer of a tissue or organ (such as the cerebral cortex)</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Cortex</em> originally meant bark in Latin, and it serves the same function as bark does for trees: to protect what’s inside. The <em>cerebral</em> <em>cortex</em> is that layer of gray matter that protects your <em>cerebrum</em>, in which all your higher mental functions are controlled.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CPR</strong> <em>n</em> abbreviation for cardiopulmonary resuscitation; the practice of reviving someone who has no pulse for breath</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>DENDRITE</strong> (DEN dryt) <em>n</em> a projection of a nerve cell that receives electric stimulation from other nerve cells</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page359"/><strong>DISTAL</strong> (DIS tul) <em>adj</em> farther from the body or point of attachment (opposite of proximal)</p>
<p class="extract">The <em>distal</em> end of your arm bone is the part your hand is attached to, because that end is farthest from the center of your body. <em>Distal</em>, of course, shares a root with <em>distant</em>, and means about the same thing; something <em>distal</em> to the body is farther away from it than something else.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>DORSAL</strong> (DOR sul) <em>adj</em> on the upper side of an animal, plant, or organ (opposite of ventral)</p>
<p class="extract">Movies with shark attacks often focus on the shark’s <em>dorsal</em> fin, exposed above the water, in order to build suspense.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>EKG</strong> <em>n</em> abbreviation for electrocardiogram; a record or display of a person’s heartbeat produced by electrocardiography</p>
<p class="extract">Some people use the abbreviation, <em>ECG</em>, because those are the letters derived from <em>E</em>lectro<em>C</em>ardio<em>G</em>ram. Others use <em>EKG</em>, perhaps because the “k” sound is heard in <em>electrocardiogram</em>, or maybe it’s because words having to do with the heart, such as <em>cardiac</em>, come from the Greek <em>kardiakos</em>. Both spellings are correct.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>ENDORPHINS</strong> (en DOR funs) <em>n</em> any of a group of hormones that occur naturally in the brain and have pain-relieving qualities</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Endorphins</em> can be released by a good workout, and some studies show that love can also be a powerful <em>endorphin</em> trigger.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>GENETIC</strong> (jen ET ik) <em>adj</em> relating to or caused by heredity; that which is passed along through our genes</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Genetics</em> is a field of science that has received more and more press over the years, as new discoveries are made in the field. Many people with <em>congenital</em> diseases hope to find treatments that can repair the <em>genetic</em> cause of their illness rather than control symptoms using medicines.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page360"/><strong>HORMONE</strong> (HAWR mohn) <em>n</em> a substance that regulates the growth or functioning of a bodily organ or tissue</p>
<p class="extract">Hormones are secreted by the body, but this term can also refer to synthetic substances that function like natural hormones.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>INSULIN</strong> (IN suh lin) <em>n</em> a hormone naturally secreted by the pancreas that regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats</p>
<p class="extract">The term <em>insulin</em> also refers to the pharmaceutical preparation taken by diabetics, who do not produce adequate levels of <em>insulin</em> naturally. Without <em>insulin</em>, glucose remains in the blood rather than being taken up by the tissues. This increased blood-sugar level can damage organs if left untreated.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>KERATIN</strong> (KER uh tin) <em>n</em> a fibrous protein forming the main structural constituent of hair, feathers, hoofs, claws, horns, etc.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>KETOSIS</strong> (kee TOH sis) <em>n</em> an abnormal increase of ketones in the body; a stage of metabolism in which the liver switches to fasting mode</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Ketosis</em> can be an unfortunate effect of diets that are extremely low in carbohydrates. When undergoing <em>ketosis</em>, the body converts fats into energy, which sounds like a great way to get rid of any of that extra cellulite you might have lying around. This process can be harmful, however, because the <em>ketones</em> that are released in your blood during <em>ketosis</em> are acidic and can do damage to your liver and kidneys.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>LATERAL</strong> (LAT uh rul) <em>adj</em> on one side of a body or organ, farthest from the median plane or “core” of the body (opposite of medial)</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Lateral</em> is similar to <em>distal</em>, in that it refers to the area away from the center of the body.</p>
<p class="extract">In everyday speech, <em>lateral</em> can also mean on the side or to the side. If you take a new job doing pretty much the same thing you were doing before, with no change in responsibility or title, that is a <em>lateral</em> move.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page361"/><strong>LIGAMENT</strong> (LIG uh ment) <em>n</em> a tough connecting tissue that holds bones or organs in place</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Ligaments</em> are often confused with tendons, because both help hold internal parts of the body together. <em>Ligate</em> and <em>ligature</em> are related words that also have to do with connecting similar things.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>MEDIAL</strong> (MEE dee ul) <em>adj</em> near the median plane or center of a body or organ (opposite of lateral)</p>
<p class="extract">Many words with <em>med</em> in them, such as <em>median</em> and <em>medium</em>, mean middle. <em>Medial</em> is similar to <em>proximal</em> as both words refer to the area near the center or core of the body.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>MELANIN</strong> (MEL uh nin) <em>n</em> a dark brown or black pigment occurring in the hair, skin, and iris of the eye in people and animals</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Melanin</em> is responsible for skin’s tanning when it is exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>METABOLISM</strong> (meh TAB oh lizm) <em>n</em> the processes by which new material is assimilated and fuel is provided for vital activities in the body.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>MRI</strong> n abbreviation for magnetic resonance imaging; medical imaging used to produce images of the internal organs</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>PITUITARY</strong> (pit OO i ter ee) <em>n</em> the major endocrine gland, which controls growth and development and the functioning of the other endocrine glands</p>
<p class="extract">If you’ve ever heard a linebacker referred to as a pituitary case, you know that the <em>pituitary</em> gland regulates growth.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>POSTERIOR</strong> (pahs TEER ee ur) <em>adj</em> situated near the back of the body (opposite of anterior)</p>
<p class="extract">Chances are that you’ve heard this word before, as a noun that means backside. In fact, many words with <em>post</em> in them—such as <em>posthumous</em> and <em>postpartum</em>—have something to do with the being after.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page362"/><strong>PROXIMAL</strong> (PRAHKS uh mul) <em>adj</em> nearer the body or point of attachment (opposite of distal)</p>
<p class="extract">The <em>proximal</em> end of your arm bone is at your armpit, because that end is nearest to the center of your body. This word shares a root with the word <em>proximity</em>, which describes how close something is.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>SYNAPSE</strong> (SIN aps) <em>n</em> a “space” between an axon of one nerve cell and a dendrite of another nerve cell, through which electric stimulation is passed.</p>
<p class="extract">If you’ve ever heard someone say that her “synapses just aren’t firing today,” that means that she’s not making connections in thought, or her thinking is slow.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>TENDON</strong> (TEN dun) <em>n</em> a tough connecting tissue that holds muscles to bones</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Tendons</em> are often confused with ligaments, but <em>tendons</em> connect only muscle to bone.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>THYROID</strong> (THY roid) <em>n</em> a large gland in the neck that secretes hormones affecting the rate of metabolism</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>VEIN</strong> (vayn) <em>n</em> tube by which blood is carried from other parts of the body back to the heart</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>VENTRAL</strong> (VEN trul) <em>adj</em> on the underside of an animal, plant, or organ (opposite of dorsal)</p>
<p class="extract">The root for <em>ventral</em> comes from the Latin, meaning to split open. The reproductive and excretive openings in some animals, such as chicken and fish, are called <em>vents</em>. And, since these <em>vents</em> happen to be on the underside of the animal, near the stomach, the underside is referred to as the <em>ventral</em> area.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page363"/><strong>VIRUS</strong> (VY rus) <em>n</em> a microscopic parasite that reproduces by invading and controlling host cells</p>
<p class="extract">Our immune systems attempt to shut down any <em>viruses</em> that enter the body and prevent them from replicating. The body’s fight against these invaders is what causes the symptoms we associate with a <em>viral</em> illness.</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Viruses</em> are not classified as living organisms because they cannot replicate on their own; they require a host to do so. <em>Viruses</em> are often confused with <em>bacteria</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>VISCERAL</strong> (VIS uh rul) <em>adj</em> relating to the internal organs in the main body cavity, especially the stomach</p>
<p class="extract">A <em>visceral</em> experience is one that someone connects with on an instinctual or bodily level, rather than mentally. To <em>eviscerate</em> an animal is to remove the guts, but the word is also used figuratively, as in “the television host <em>eviscerated</em> his guest.”</p>
