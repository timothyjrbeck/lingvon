<h1 class="chap_title">Literature 101</h1>
<p class="extract" style="page-break-before: always; padding-top: 1em;"><a id="page366"/>Why do freshman literature classes all seem to start at 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>? We don’t know the answer to that, but we do know plenty of people who rarely managed to make it to class. If you’re one of them, be sure to review this glossary of literary terms and allusions that have become part of common speech. It’ll allow you to hang with the English majors—even if you studied the backs of your eyelids more than your literature texts as an undergrad.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>ALLUSION</strong> (uh LOO zhun) <em>n</em> the act of referring to something—often a literary text—without mentioning it directly</p>
<p class="extract">Example: In a fit of optimism, the novice playwright chose William Bard as his pen name.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CATCH-22</strong> (KACH twen tee too) <em>n</em> a situation that is characterized by absurdity, or impossible to get out of because of conflicting conditions.</p>
<p class="extract">Though the term is frequently used today to describe any difficult situation, in <em>Catch-22</em>, a novel by Joseph Heller, the term referred to a “catch” imposed by the U.S. Army to keep pilots flying combat missions. This “catch-22” was that the only way to get excused from flying combat missions was insanity, but only a sane person would be in fear of his life and request to be removed from flying combat missions. Therefore, the request to be removed would always be turned down.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>DRAMATIC IRONY</strong> (druh MAT ik EYE ruh nee) <em>n</em> the condition in which the reader’s understanding of a character’s situation is more accurate than the character’s own understanding of his or her situation; also called situational or tragic irony</p>
<p class="extract">Example: In O. Henry’s short story, “The Gift of the Magi,” a man pawns his watch to buy a gift of hair combs for his wife. Meanwhile, his wife has cut off and sold her hair to buy him a watch chain.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page367"/><strong>FAUSTIAN</strong> (FOW stee un) <em>adj</em> done without regard for future consequences</p>
<p class="extract">In German legend, Johann Faust is a magician and alchemist who sells his soul to the devil in return for power and knowledge. A common use of the term today is in the term “Faustian bargain.”</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>GARGANTUAN</strong> (gar GAN choo un) <em>adj</em> huge</p>
<p class="extract">Though many people (and even dictionaries) have forgotten the literary etymology of this word, its origin is in the book <em>Gargantua and Pantagruel</em>, by François Rabelais. The character Gargantua is a voracious giant.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>HYPERBOLE</strong> (hy PUR boh lee) <em>n</em> an extreme exaggeration for dramatic effect</p>
<p class="extract">Example: When my mom comes home and sees this mess, she’s going to kill me!</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>LILLIPUTIAN</strong> (lil uh PYOO shun) <em>adj</em> trivial or small</p>
<p class="extract">In Jonathan Swift’s <em>Gulliver’s</em> <em>Travels</em>, Gulliver travels to many strange places, one of which is Lilliput, an imaginary country inhabited by people who are six inches tall.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>MACHIAVELLIAN</strong> (mah kee ah VEL ee un) <em>adj</em> characterized by deceit, cunning, and bad faith</p>
<p class="extract">Niccolo Machiavelli was a philosopher, political advisor, and writer. He wrote <em>The</em> <em>Prince</em>, a political treatise in which he advocates cruelty, fraudulence, and the idea that the end justifies the means.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>METAPHOR</strong> (MET uh for) <em>n</em> figure of speech likening two dissimilar things</p>
<p class="extract">Example: Juliet is the sun.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page368"/><strong>ORWELLIAN</strong> (or WEL lee un) <em>adj</em> relating to or similar to works of George Orwell, particularly with respect to a vision of a totalitarian future</p>
<p class="extract">George Orwell’s <em>1984</em> and <em>Animal</em> <em>Farm</em> are some of the most chilling tales of all-powerful governments ever told. In Orwell’s best-known novel, <em>1984</em>, all people were under constant surveillance by Big Brother, and were reminded of it in the omnipresent slogan, “Big Brother is watching you.” (TV addicts may be familiar with the term “Big Brother” from a reality TV show of the same name, which started in the late ’90s.) Other terms that originated in <em>1984</em> include <em>groupthink</em>, <em>newspeak</em>, and <em>thought</em> <em>police</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>PARADOX</strong> (PAR uh dahks) <em>n</em> a literally false statement that only has meaning if interpreted figuratively</p>
<p class="extract">Example: Less is more.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>PERSONIFICATION</strong> (pur SAHN i fi cay shun) <em>n</em> the attribution of human qualities to something that is not human</p>
<p class="extract">Example: The yellow fog rubs its back upon the windowpanes.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>PYGMALION</strong> (pig MAY lee un) <em>n</em> a character, particularly a man, who creates a person to fit his liking</p>
<p class="extract">Pygmalion was a mythical king of Cyprus who carved a statue of ivory that was so lovely, he prayed to Aphrodite to make it come alive. The term also refers to a type of story in which a similar plot plays out, such as <em>My</em> <em>Fair</em> <em>Lady</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Taming</em> <em>of</em> <em>the</em> <em>Shrew</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>QUIXOTIC</strong> (kwik SAH tik) <em>adj</em> idealistic to the point of being impractical</p>
<p class="extract">This word is derived from the novel <em>Don</em> <em>Quixote</em>, by Miguel de Cervantes. The title character is a low-ranking member of Spanish nobility who—after reading too many tales about knights and their noble endeavors—decides to journey the countryside looking for adventures and righting wrongs. His actions are well-intentioned but often end in disaster—hence, the meaning of the word <em>quixotic</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page369"/><strong>SATIRE</strong> (SAT y ur) <em>n</em> a form of writing, usually involving irony, which makes fun of people or events in order to bring about social or political change</p>
<p class="extract">Example: In the essay “A Modest Proposal,” the narrative voice argues that the children of poor Catholics in Ireland should be fattened up and fed to rich landowners.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>SIMILE</strong> (SIM uh lee) <em>n</em> figure of speech using “like” or “as” to draw a comparison</p>
<p class="extract">Example: My love is like a red, red rose.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>SIREN SONG</strong> (SY ren song) <em>n</em> an enchanting appeal, especially if it is deceptive and will lead to a bad result</p>
<p class="extract">Sirens were mythical creatures in <em>The</em> <em>Odyssey</em> who enticed sailors to their island by singing a luring song. The island had rocky cliffs, though, and sailors who attempted to land were always dashed upon the rocks and drowned. Odysseus overcame this by plugging his sailors’ ears with wax and having them tie him to the mast, so that he could hear the <em>siren</em> <em>song</em> but would be unable to succumb to it.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>STYGIAN</strong> (STI jee un) <em>adj</em> very dark</p>
<p class="extract">The River Styx in Greek mythology is the river that leads to the underworld, or Hades. Naturally, it’s pretty dark, and that is the origin of the word <em>stygian</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>VERBAL IRONY</strong> (VUR bul EYE ruh nee) <em>n</em> the use of words to express something other than their literal intent</p>
<p class="extract">Example: How brilliant do you have to be to lock your keys in the car twice in one day?</p>
