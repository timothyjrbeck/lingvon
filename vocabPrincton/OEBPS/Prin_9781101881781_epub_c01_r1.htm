<h1 class="chap_title">Vocabulary and the GRE</h1>
<h2 class="section_brk"><a id="page8"/>Using Language</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Humans communicate through language, and although gestures and facial expressions are important means of communication, we most often rely on words to express ourselves. How many times have you been frustrated because you didn’t have the right words to say what you meant? The broader your vocabulary, the more precisely you can communicate your ideas to others.</p>
<p class="extract">Think about playing Telephone, the game in which the first player whispers something to the second, and then the second player whispers what she heard to the third person, and so on. You find out how mangled the original sentence has become by the time it reaches the last person. The more carefully the first player articulates the sentence, the less extreme the alterations are along the way. Of course, playing Telephone is not much fun if the sentence doesn’t change. The whole point of the game, after all, is to see how distorted the original sentence becomes. What is entertaining in Telephone, however, is frustrating when you are trying to make a point. When you use words that <em>sort of</em> mean what you want to say, the margin of error for your listener or reader is much greater than if you can choose the words that mean <em>exactly</em> what you intend them to. In effect, you have greater control over the message when you have a clear command of the words that convey it.</p>
<p class="extract">The way you express yourself may also have an impact on how people view you. How do you decide how “smart” you think someone is? These days it’s probably not the fountain pen, or the monocle, or the stack of weighty tomes under someone’s arm that gives you an impression of intelligence. For better or worse, people draw their sense of our abilities largely from the language we use. In the end, <em>how</em> you say something matters as much as <em>what</em> you are trying to say.</p>
<p class="extract">The same thing will be true in grad school: You will be evaluated not only by the ideas you have, but also by how well you convey those <a id="page9"/>ideas. Words are the tools you will use to express yourself in your personal statement when you apply to grad school, and later in your coursework, seminar papers, and publications. The more precisely you can use language, the more seriously your ideas will be taken.</p>
<p class="extract">Before you can get to grad school, though, you’ve got to deal with the GRE.</p>
<h2 class="section">Vocabulary and the GRE</h2>
<p class="nonindent">For the most part, the GRE doesn’t measure what you know. Instead, it tests how you work through certain kinds of problems. The most important exception to this is vocabulary. In this way, vocabulary is one of the few “content areas” tested on the exam. You’ll be happy to know that the level of math tested on the GRE is not any higher than the level tested on the SAT. However, the trickiness of the vocabulary tested on the GRE can be harder than that on the SAT. The company that makes the test, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), figures that even if you haven’t studied math since your first year in college, you should still have been building your vocabulary continuously since high school. Thus, the range of words ETS expects you to know on the GRE is that much wider.</p>
<p class="extract">There is some good news, though. Memorizing the dictionary is <em>not</em> the best way to improve your knowledge of the vocabulary that will be tested on the GRE. There is a particular range of words tested, and plenty of words in the dictionary will never show up on this test. The words that the GRE tests range from words you know well (<em>fruit, angry, write</em>), to words you recognize and may use on occasion (<em>cohesion, discrete, replicate</em>), to words you may never have encountered before (<em>taciturn, stentorian, palliate</em>). Because the GRE does not test your knowledge of specific subjects, you don’t need to know the technical language, or jargon, particular to any discipline. Nor does the test include truly esoteric words that are very technical, or specific to a discipline, or just plain weird (words like <em>sesquipedalian</em>).</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="page10"/>Not only does ETS stick to a range of vocabulary, but it also seems to go through phases in which certain words pass in and out of vogue. Some words show up frequently on the test, and then seem to fall out of favor, only to return to their former glory at some later point. The vocabulary in this book includes the GRE Hit Parade, the words most frequently tested on the GRE, along with a bunch of ETS’s other perennial favorites. We keep the Hit Parade updated to reflect the words that currently appear with the greatest frequency. By memorizing these words, you are learning the words that tend to yield a higher score on the Verbal.</p>
<p class="extract">Of course, there’s no guarantee that any individual word will show up on the test you take, but the ones in <a class="hlink" href="Prin_9781101881781_epub_c04_r1.htm">Chapter 4</a> of this book are the ones most likely to appear. As you learn these words, you will also get a sense of the vocabulary tested on the GRE. You will start to recognize words as “GRE words” and can augment your list accordingly. You will also be increasing your ability to communicate your ideas precisely in your daily life. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<h3 class="section">The Verbal Section of the GRE</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Now that the kinds of words that are used on the GRE have been introduced, it’s important to look at how they are used in the questions and how expanding your vocabulary can help you succeed. The Verbal portion of the GRE is comprised of 4 question types: Text Completions, Sentence Equivalence, Reading Comprehension, and Arguments. (ETS considers Argument questions to be a type of Reading Comprehension question.) These question types utilize vocabulary in different ways.</p>
<p class="extract">Text Completion questions provide a sentence or series of related sentences with one, two, or three blanks in place of words in the sentence. The answer choices will reflect these blanks and you will have to fill in the blank using the words in the answer choices. The words in the answer choices may be fairly familiar, but these can get tricky, as the second, less-common definition of the word is often <a id="page11"/>the one being tested. The sentence itself tends to use vocabulary of a higher difficulty level, but tends to provide you with context clues that can be used to fill in the blanks. Use everything that you’re given, as without understanding the context, it will be difficult to select the word that most accurately completes the sentence.</p>
<p class="extract">Much like Text Completions, Sentence Equivalence questions will present a sentence with a blank and ask you to fill in the blank with the answer choices. However, each Sentence Equivalence question presents you with six answer choice options and asks you to select the two words that best complete the sentence and create similar meanings. This question type typically tests the toughest vocabulary on the test and frequently features incorrect answer choice pairs that are related to each other, but do not complete the intended meaning of the sentence. A good grasp on GRE vocabulary helps to eliminate words that do not match the sentence’s intended meaning, which aids in finding the correct answers.</p>
<p class="extract">Reading Comprehension questions test vocabulary in similar ways. They don’t necessarily require you to know the definition of a tough word, but they may present an unfamiliar word in the context of the passage or argument that must be read or analyzed. Without knowledge of these pivotal words, you may not achieve a full understanding of the passage.</p>
<p class="extract">This book contains many different kinds of methods for learning the words commonly tested on the GRE. Some of these tactics include analogies and antonyms, which are not included on the GRE. However, because this kind of word association work is very valuable in learning new vocabulary, we have decided to include these types of drills in this book. Note also that while the Complete the Sentence drills are very similar in structure to the One Blank Text Completions that you’ll see on the GRE, their emphasis is on learning vocabulary. For more information and examples regarding the types of questions you’ll see on the verbal sections of the GRE, check out our <em>Cracking the GRE</em> book.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a id="page12"/>Adaptive Tests and the Importance of Vocabulary</h3>
<p class="nonindent">The GRE is adaptive by section, which means that your performance on the first scored verbal section will determine the difficulty level of the next scored verbal section. If you do well on the first section, you’ll get vocabulary that the GRE considers to be tougher in the second section. While this increases the maximum score you can earn, an abysmal performance on these harder questions is actually less valuable than turning in solid work on the medium versions of both sections. To that end, it is useful to gain familiarity with as many vocabulary words as possible, as the greater the number of words that you know, the greater your chances are of fully understanding passages, identifying common answer traps, and recognizing clues to questions. A good grasp of vocabulary will also help you to quickly identify words and eliminate incorrect answer choices, which will allow you to maximize time on the questions you may be more unsure of.</p>
<h3 class="section">Analytical Writing</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Although the Analytical Writing portion of the GRE does not directly test your vocabulary, the language you use will definitely play a role in the score you receive. As we discussed earlier, the more precisely you choose your words, the more certain you can be of accurately conveying your ideas. Also, using a variety of words properly will improve your score. Notice that we said properly! This is an important caveat for the GRE essays and the rest of your life. A big word improperly used can be more dangerous than a nice safe word used correctly.</p>
<p class="extract">Using a word properly doesn’t just mean picking a word with a dictionary definition that matches your intended meaning. Context matters too. You have to know whether the word you want is only used in the plural, or if it always goes with a particular <a id="page13"/>preposition. Is there a particular phrase it’s usually seen in? Is it only used literally or can it be used metaphorically as well? Learning words in context will ensure that you can answer these questions. It will also allow you to use your new vocabulary on the two essays with confidence. That’s why each of the definitions in this book is accompanied by one or more sentences illustrating how the word is used in context. We’ve also tried to point out the most common errors people make, along with any other useful clues to using these words in a truly erudite fashion.</p>
<p class="extract">Now that you know how these words will help you improve your score on the GRE and enable you to express yourself more effectively, we’re ready to discuss strategies for learning them.</p>
