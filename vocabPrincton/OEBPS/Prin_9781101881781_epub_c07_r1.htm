<h1 class="chap_title">Foreign Words</h1>
<p class="extract" style="page-break-before: always; padding-top: 1em;"><a id="page350"/>This chapter is designed to increase your familiarity with words or phrases that are commonly used in American culture that may not have originated from English words. The first definition listed is generally how the word is used in American speech.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>APARTHEID</strong> (uh PART yt) <em>n</em> [Afrikaans] the policy of racial segregation and oppression in the Republic of South Africa</p>
<p class="extract">Though <em>apartheid</em> does refer to a specific policy in a certain place and time, it can be used more generally to mean any strict system of segregation and discrimination by race. The literal meaning in Afrikaans is “apartness.”</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>BLITZKRIEG</strong> (BLITS kreeg) <em>n</em> [German] a swift, overwhelming attack employing speed and surprise</p>
<p class="extract">The literal translation means lightning war, and in WWII, <em>blitzkriegs</em> referred to the massive air attacks that the Germans carried out. Today the word is often shortened to <em>blitz</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CHAI</strong> (chye) <em>n</em> [Swahili and many South Asian dialects] tea</p>
<p class="extract">To Westerners, <em>chai</em> denotes particular kinds of spiced black tea, but in many places in Africa and India, it is the generic word for tea [so to say <em>chai</em> <em>tea</em> is actually redundant].</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CHI</strong> (chee) <em>n</em> [Chinese] life force</p>
<p class="extract">Traditional Chinese philosophy holds that <em>chi</em> is inherent in everything, and a proper balance of positive and negative forms is essential for good physical health. You may also see this word spelled <em>qi</em>.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>CHUTZPAH</strong> (HUTS puh) <em>n</em> [Yiddish] audacity, gall</p>
<p class="extract">Generally <em>chutzpah</em> connotes brashness, in a negative sense; however, it is often used admiringly in English speech.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page351"/><strong>COUP D’ÉTAT</strong> (KOO day TAH) <em>n</em> [French] a sudden, violent overthrow of the government</p>
<p class="extract">The literal meaning in French is blow of the state. You may already be familiar with the word <em>coup</em> on its own, and it’s often used to mean any victory; <em>coup</em> <em>d’état</em> is used more for governmental and organizational overthrows.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>DOPPELGÄNGER</strong> (DAHP el gang ur) <em>n</em> [German] a wraith or ghostlike twin of a living person; an alter ego</p>
<p class="extract">German for double, <em>doppelgänger</em> usually refers to an alter ego, or haunted version of a living person.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>FIESTA</strong> (fee EST uh) <em>n</em> [Spanish] party</p>
<p class="extract">Though we generally use the term to mean any party, in Spanish it often connotes a religious festival or large celebration.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>GESTALT</strong> (geh SHTALT) <em>n</em> [German] shape or form</p>
<p class="extract">While there is no direct translation from German for <em>gestalt</em>, we generally use the term to mean anything having to do with shape, form, or arrangement.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>INTIFADA</strong> (in ti FAH dah) <em>n</em> [Arabic] rebellion, uprising</p>
<p class="extract">While the generic meaning of <em>intifada</em> is the throwing off of oppression, it can also specifically refer to the Palestinian uprisings in the late 1980s.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>KANBAN</strong> (KAHN bahn) <em>n</em> [Japanese] the means by which JIT [just-in-time] manufacturing is managed</p>
<p class="extract">The original meaning of <em>kanban</em> is sign or card, and it refers to a system of just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing created to minimize the need to store anything during the manufacturing process. It can also refer to the signaling system used to indicate that something is needed at each step in the process.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page352"/><strong>KUDOS</strong> (KOO dohz) <em>n</em> [Greek] praise, accolades</p>
<p class="extract">In Greek this word means that which is heard of, and we suppose that if your boss (finally!) gave you <em>kudos</em> for a job well done, you’d probably want the world to hear about it, too.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>MAHATMA</strong> (mah HOT mah) <em>n</em> [Sanskrit] a title of respect for a holy or wise man</p>
<p class="extract">Perhaps the most familiar use of the word <em>mahatma</em> to Westerners is in reference to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who is often referred to as Mahatma Gandhi out of respect.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>MENSCH</strong> (mensh) <em>n</em> [Yiddish] a decent human being</p>
<p class="extract">Literally human in the German variants that influenced Yiddish, a <em>mensch</em> is a complimentary term that means someone who can always be counted on to do the right thing.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>OMBUDSMAN</strong> (AHM buds mun) <em>n</em> [Swedish] one who is appointed to investigate complaints against organizations and public officials</p>
<p class="extract">Most universities have an <em>ombudsman</em>, though many students may not know what his or her official duties are. NGOs private companies, and other organizations may have them, as well.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>PATOIS</strong> (pah TWAH) <em>n</em> [French] jargon or specialized language</p>
<p class="extract">The original meaning was clumsy or nonstandard speech, such as the provincial speech you might have that marked you as being from a certain region.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>SCHADENFREUDE</strong> (SHAH den froy duh) <em>n</em> [German] pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others</p>
<p class="extract">A person might feel <em>schadenfreude</em> when she didn’t get a desired promotion, but the person who got the job is having an awful experience. This comes from the German <em>Schaden</em> (destruction) and <em>Freude</em> (joy).</p>
<p class="extractfont"><a id="page353"/><strong>SHALOM</strong> (shuh LOM) <em>n</em> [Hebrew] hello, good-bye</p>
<p class="extract">The literal meaning is peace, which has become a greeting in the English-speaking world, as well. Other languages have related words, such as the Arabic <em>salam</em> and city names such as Salem and Jerusalem share roots with this word, as well.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>SIESTA</strong> (see EST uh) <em>n</em> [Spanish] nap</p>
<p class="extract">Though we tend to just use <em>siesta</em> to mean a nap, <em>siesta</em> in the Spanish tradition is a nap after the midday meal, and the word shares a root with the Spanish word for sixth, because the <em>siesta</em> would take place in the sixth hour or midday.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>TAPAS</strong> (TAH pahs) <em>n</em> [Spanish] appetizers or small servings of food</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Tapas</em> are generally ordered and shared among a group, and can be anything from plates of olives to more elaborate or substantial side dishes.</p>
<p class="extract"><em>Tapa</em> is actually Spanish for cover, and the etymology of the term is under dispute. To add to the confusion, with the increasing popularity of <em>tapas</em> bars throughout the world, we’ve heard more than one conversation in which someone mistakenly thought someone else suggested going to a topless bar to eat.</p>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>TSCHOTCHKE</strong> (CHAHCH kee) <em>n</em> [Yiddish] inexpensive trinket</p>
<p class="extract">Originally from a Slavic word for toys, <em>tschotchkes</em> can be a variety of knickknacks, baubles, or souvenirs. The spelling on this word can vary significantly.</p>
