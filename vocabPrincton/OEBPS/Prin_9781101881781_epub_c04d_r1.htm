<p class="extract">This one gets a little complicated. <em>Disinterested</em> and uninterested have a pretty convoluted history. <em>Uninterested</em>, when it first showed up in the seventeenth century, meant “impartial.” At some point, though, that meaning was replaced in popular usage with its current meaning: “not caring or having an interest in,” as in the sentence, “I am completely <em>uninterested</em> in attending the concert.” At about the same time, the original use of <em>disinterested</em> to mean “not caring or having an interest in” was changing in favor of “free from bias.”</p>
<div class="hint">
<p class="hint">Confused yet? It gets worse. To recap: <em>disinterested</em> means “unbiased” and <em>uninterested</em> means “uncaring,” right? However, increasingly writers are switching them back around. The people who police the proper usage of words in English say this isn’t allowable, but the writers do it anyway. Usually you can tell from context which definition someone intends.</p>
