<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">His <em>jejune</em> response to our questions revealed how young he was despite his apparent age.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">After surviving on a <em>jejune</em> diet of saltines and ginger ale during my illness, I was ready for a more nutritious meal.</li>

<p class="extractfont"><strong>JIBE</strong> (jyb) <em>v</em> to agree, to be in accord</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Since their accounts of the evening’s events didn’t <em>jibe</em>, we knew at least one of them wasn’t telling the full truth.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">I was relieved to find that my account balance <em>jibed</em> with my calculations so that I didn’t bounce a check.</li>
</ul>
<p class="extractfont"><strong>JOCOSE</strong> (joh KOHS) <em>adj</em> given to joking; humorous</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">The <em>jocose</em> man could always be counted on for some levity, but it was almost impossible to get him to stop joking even for a minute.</li>
</ul>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Jocular</em> is very similar to <em>jocose</em>, but <em>jocund</em> is slightly different in that it means high-spirited rather than specifically humorous. <em>Jocularity</em> is fun characterized by humor.</p>
