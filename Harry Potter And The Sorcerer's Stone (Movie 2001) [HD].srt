'An unsolved community rival in a village'

4
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,590
We can't even enter the temples

5
00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:01,015
Our children are not
allowed inside schools

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,440
So if we live in run-down
houses and wear shabby clothes...

7
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:04,615
Are we lesser beings?

8
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,040
Why do we still live this way?

9
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,520
Because they don't let us grow,
We're still their slaves

10
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:11,080
This school we're building...

11
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,800
...will be a slap on the face
to the people of upper caste

12
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,414
We are uneducated

13
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
At least let our
children go to school

14
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:20,626
Or we'll be crushed
under their tyranny forever

15
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,615
We shall unite against them!

16
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,580
They call themselves higher caste
What does that even mean?

17
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,765
Only they're allowed
to enter temples

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,520
So wearing this anklet
makes one superior?

19
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:33,095
I'm holding it now

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,840
If I wear this around my ankle,
am I one of them?

21
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,375
May I enter the temples now?

22
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:41,320
We must end this!

23
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,733
We shall not tolerate this anymore

In the name of caste, the ruthless massacre
of forty men women and children...

25

In the Uttarakhand massacre
that shook the country...

26
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,095
The Court have arrived at a verdict

27
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:19,775
At the end of the trial,
The Court finds the defendant...

-Is it Dass Travels? 2-4-1-
-Told you it's the wrong number!

35
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:49,049
Go to hell, man!
Such a bad start

36
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,401
Is there tea?

37
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:56,571
Yes, there is

38
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,700
What's the sticker for?

39
00:03:58,843 --> 00:03:59,843
Dass Travels!

40
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,215
Oh and write down our
phone number and address...

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,280
Make it easier for the cops?
Take it down, fools!

00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:06,025
-What's it?
-Tea, brother?

-Give it to me

Brother, he always gets
to wear the Inspector's uniform

-He never lets me have it
-Let it go, man

-Okay

172
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,600
Wait!

173
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,360
There were seven cars

174
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,960

So who is missing?

177
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
Oh

178
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,000
The blue car went swimming, eh?

179
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,880
And?

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,920
Oh my god!
It's the police

181
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,360
Won't you change clothes?
The chase is over

182
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,640
Is there a problem, brother?

183
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,680
Okay, take it

184
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,960
Oh! It's food

185
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,120
I'll take it

186
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,280
Where is the 'holy stuff'?

187
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,480
Holy stuff?

188
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,720
Is that your code word
for the goods?

189
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,240
The other day, one guy used
the code word 'Fried Chicken'

190
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,520
I thought he meant-

191
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,880
-Hear something?
-Where is it?

192
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,800
It was delivered at 10 o clock
I'm all about punctuality

193
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Show him your watch

194
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,480
See?

195
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
It's 10:10

196
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:27,305
We've been chasing you for an hour!

197
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
You weren't really looking

198
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
You, rascal!

199
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Thank you

200
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,160
This was my fee
Take it if you want

201
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,840
But I'll finish at least four of you

202
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:57,665
What day is it?
At least four of you

203
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,240
Who's coming first?

204
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,640
Who wants to be my starter?

205
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,000
You? Or you?

206
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,840
You...you're last

207
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,480
Where are you from?
What's your name?

208
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,720
I'm Gates

209
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,320
Bill Gates

210
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,920
Catch him

211
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,000
So I looked at him, right?

212
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,520
I swerved the steering
The car just drifted around

213
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,720
I wanted to shake that guy up,
but he's telling them bedtime stories

214
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,680
I thought it's all over...

215
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,400
What's he doing?

216
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,960
Counting the money for him

217
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,480
Come here, he was like this
And I was here...

218
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,080
But I didn't budge!

219
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,920
I went like this
And got through!

220
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,000
That was that
The client was happy, I was happy

221
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,800
I took my fee and was off

222
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,243
Then why did you quit?

223
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:54,748
Can't work for a mistrustful employer
who thinks you're stealing fuel, right?

224
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320
-That's true
-He's got dignity

225
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,360
#NAME?

226
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,375
Then I drove an ambulance
in Nungambakkam for a while

227
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,960
That lasted six months

228
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:03,345
An ambulance, too?

229
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,210
That explains your
antics behind the wheel

230
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,715
Green tea is for the man

231
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,339
He just got here
What's happening?

232
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:11,004
I've added honey
Is that okay?

233
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:11,869
That's fine

234
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:14,414
Can you check on the food?
I smell something burning

235
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:15,938
I smell it too

236
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:18,043
But someone's getting burnt here

237
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,771
You make money in such means
What do you do with the money?

238
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm asking you

239
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,459
Why is he getting so emotional?

240
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:33,332
I have a little sister

241
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,130
Once while going in the car,
there was an accident

242
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:37,475
It was my mistake

243
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:43,755
So I make money by any means;
All for my sister

244
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,180
She was hit on the back of
her head and she fell into a...

245
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:47,586
A coma!

246
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,849
Yes, how did you know, brother?

247
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,474
Been seeing it in movies

248
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,873
You should come with me

249
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:54,418
Want me to drop you somewhere?

250
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:56,803
I'm saying, come with me
Let's do 'jobs' together

251
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:58,108
What jobs?

252
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:01,795
Like, I came in the morning
The package was exchanged

253
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,315
And then we fought

254
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:05,123
-I'll check and tell you
-Check and tell?

255
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,228
Listen to me
What's wrong with him?

256
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,933
He's taking my apprentice away!

257
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:11,027
Dass Travels

258
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,453
Hmmm, okay

259
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:19,278
Okay

260
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,573
Okay?

261
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:26,478
Brother, working for
a boss doesn't work for me

262
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,703
Just tell me when
there's a job, I'll do it

263
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:30,317
This is what
they're talking about?

264
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,822
Finished counting?

265
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,120
What did he ask?

266
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,905
He asked if Dass was
related to Lord Labough Dash

267
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,690
There's 100 in this bundle
But only 98 in this

268
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:41,395
How they cheat us!

269
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,720
Here, that makes it 100!

270
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,180
I'm off!

271
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,492
Here, keep it

272
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:49,243
Bye!

273
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:52,018
Hey, give me your phone number
I'll call you when a job comes up

274
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,123
Phone number?

275
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:54,588
Hey, Police costume

276
00:17:58,569 --> 00:17:59,809
Your name?

277
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,624
Wonder what he'll
call himself this time

278
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:12,826
Where is she hiding?

279
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:14,651
She is not in room

280
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,280
Where has she gone?

281
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,185
It's my fault, letting you stay here

282
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,930
Two months since she paid the rent

283
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:22,235
Tell her to meet me
when she's back

284
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,308
What?

285
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,026
Saw a cockroach, madam

286
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,907
Who knows when you'll find
a good job and pay me my rent?

287
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,491
Women drivers wanted at
airport to drive battery cars

288
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:39,876
Great pay!

289
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,660
-As soon as I get my license...
-You need to learn driving first

290
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,438
-What's the package worth?
-Two big ones

291
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,860
I know a guy
I'll check

292
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,490
-Bond?
-Who is it?

293
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:01,451
It's me, Dass

294
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:03,876
Dass? Brother! Tell me

295
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,550
A jeep needs to be brought
from Pondicherry, you'll do it?

296
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,415
No, brother
I'm at work now, I will...

297
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,080
It's a valuable package, man
I can't just send anyone

298
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:14,545
You said you'd work for me;
But you keep backing out

299
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,399
I called you because
it's an important task

300
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,504
-I'll pay you good
-Pondicherry?

301
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,143
How far from here?

302
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:22,926
Consider it done

303
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,480
If you can drive this,
you can drive a real car

304
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Sit down

305
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,680
Sit

306
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,440
It's just like a normal car

307
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,400
What about the stick here?

308
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,080
No gears on this car

309
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:04,385
But you'll find everything else
The steering, controls...

310
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,880
Don't be afraid

311
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,600
-The one on the left is the brake
-Isn't that the accelerator?

312
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,920
I know to drive-

313
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,400
Look at that!

314
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,040
Nut case!

315
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,040
Take your hands off!
Look at that face

316
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,520
7...8...9...10
Okay, I'm off!

317
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:47,066
-Brother?
-Come here

318
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,280
-Is it ready?
-Ready

319
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,440
Brother!

320
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,320
He's not left? Hide it

321
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,000
What's this?

322
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
You're earning so much

323
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,200
But look at what you've paid me!

324
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,120
Look, this note is torn

325
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Okay

326
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,360
You scared me!

327
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,123
Who is this guy?

328
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:37,348
Never seen him here before

329
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:38,964
He's new

330
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:40,255
What's his name?

331
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
Oh no! Never ask for his name

332
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:46,682
"On asking name you are irritating"

333
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:49,427
"Tell the truth who are you?"

334
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,601
"Taking fees you are confusing"

335
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:55,146
"Tell the truth who are you?"

336
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,200
"If I rush it is bullet
Danger is like chicklet"

337
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:24,667
"I'm a car driving flight jet
I'm a magnet for girls"

338
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,828
"There is no cage for me"

339
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:36,093
"Why there is so much
anger in your heart?"

340
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:41,558
"Pray what you want
My name is Bond"

341
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,200
Your name?

342
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:45,451
Bond

343
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:47,168
James Bond

344
00:23:19,394 --> 00:23:22,274
"On asking name you are irritating"

345
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,859
"Tell the truth who are you?"

346
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,949
"Taking fees you are confusing"

347
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:30,635
"Tell the truth who are you?"

348
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:36,621
"There is no fear in my eyes
There is no one to my level"

349
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,680
"For everyone I'm a pet
To the enemy I'm a nuisance"

350
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,000
"There is no fence to me
Till I play it is jolly"

351
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,720
"On hitting everything
will get destroyed"

352
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,960
"My name is Kohli"

353
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,200
"Kohli Virat Kohli"

354
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,600
'Virat Kohli hits a six'

355
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,280
She was right here
Don't know where she's gone?

356
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
She just disappeared

357
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,080
We've come here on a picnic
from Mother Teresa Ladies Hostel

358
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,240
We were a group of 40

359
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,320
The other 39 have lost their way

360
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,000
I am safe

361
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,800
She lost her way
but blaming us

362
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,720
Go, get her

363
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,240
"On asking name you are irritating"

364
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,960
"Tell the truth who are you?"

365
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,240
"Taking fees you are confusing"

366
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,880
"Tell the truth who are you?"

367
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,920
"My home town is Paramakudi
Find out who I'm"

368
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,560
"I know all the tricks
Learn it from me"

369
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Who are you?

370
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,240
"For learning I didn't
go for tuition"

371
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,480
"But in acting I'm an ocean"

372
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,320
"Something new is my fashion
My name is Haasan"

373
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,440
"Haasan...Kamal Haasan"

374
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,520
"Are you a good
or bad person?"

375
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,360
"Dance...dance"

376
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
Come on dance

377
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,800
"Rock...rock"

378
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,880
'Somewhere in North India'

379
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,840
Was it you?
You clicked this photo?

380
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,280
I clicked it at an event in Chennai

381
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,600
Do you know anything else about her?

382
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,640
I don't know

383
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,720
Do you have hard copies?

384
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,880
I gave all the hard
and soft copies to him

385
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,960
Ajay!

386
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,440
Everything's in order, brother

387
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,680
So

388
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,160
What's your fee?

389
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,720
It's your wish

390
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,720
What's this?

391
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,840
It's that girl's

392
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,400
-Why haven't you sent it, yet?
-We just got the address

393
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
We cut it an hour back!

394
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
If her father doesn't pay up,
tell him we'll chop off her hand

395
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,440
-Hello, Dass?
-Sir?

396
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,640
Can't hear him
Tell me, brother

397
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,680
I'll e-mail you a photograph

398
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,640
Okay, sir

399
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,160
Do a background check

400
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,600
Like last time?

401
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,400
Just collect the details
I'll tell you what to do

402
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Scan these photographs
and mail them to Dass's ID

403
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,480
So

404
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,200
-Has anyone else seen these?
-Absolutely not

405
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,720
Only you

406
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,640
Good! No one will
get to see it

407
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,960
What?

408
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,520
Blade

409
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,720
He's a good friend of mine
I'll introduce you to him

410
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,680
Sure

411
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,040
Blade, meet my friend

412
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,360
What is this?

413
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,800
Blade

414
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,720
Darling, squeeze a bit of lemon and
add some salt to this orange punch

415
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,440
It tastes heavenly

416
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,720
-We've got a mail
-Already?

417
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,040
Yes, a girl's photo

418
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,960
No student has failed a test,
ever since my father's time

419
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,320
Be seated
Your instructor will be here

420
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,240
Why have you
lined up all the photos?

421
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,640
Why so many photos?

422
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,040
I take a new photograph
each time I apply for driver's license

423
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,200
Oh So?

424
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,440
She's only failed 14 times till now
This would be the 15th attempt

425
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,720
But I'll surely pass this time!

426
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,720
You've come to the best driving school
You will pass hundred percent

427
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,240
I already know because I'm
wearing my lucky colour maroon

428
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,720
But you wore the same colour when
you failed at the Anna Nagar center

429
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,320
That was in March
My lucky colour was green then

430
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,080
Right

431
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,720
Morning, Boss

432
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,720
This is your instructor

433
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,040
-Hello, sir!
-Sit down

434
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,880
Have we met before?

435
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,960
I have

436
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,800
The other day

437
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,440
You'll attend 15 classes totally
3, 500 rupees

438
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
-Your name?
-Shakeela

439
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,240
Why not? Can't people be
named after adult movie stars?

440
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
What's your mum's name?
Parangimalai Jyoti?

441
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,000
Boss!

442
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,680
How did you know?

443
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,480
But not Parimala

444
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,120
She's from
Viralimalai, near Trichy

445
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,440
Sis!

446
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:20,508
They're teasing you

447
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:24,706
-What's your name?
-Ratnam

448
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:25,971
Mani Ratnam

449
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:27,080
Your address?

450
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:30,117
4/3 Barathidas third cross street
Manapakkam

451
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:32,432
There's a cemetery right
next to this ladies' hostel

452
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,069
This girl lives here

453
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,000
Have you collected
all the details?

454
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,440
No politicians or police
connection in her family?

455
00:29:38,465 --> 00:29:40,025
No such thing

456
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,160
So we'll take the job?

457
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,360
Wow...! Next job

458
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,080
Did you check the birthmark?

459
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,840
A mole on the right ear
Yes, it's here

460
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,600
This is the right girl, huh?

461
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,979
She's feisty

462
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,320
I'll kill you
Let us go

463
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Who is this hero?
Why is he getting so excited?

464
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,400
He's her boyfriend
Send him away

465
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:14,498
I've told you,
I don't like extra baggage

466
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:17,400
You can't get away with this
I'll kill you!

467
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:19,404
What does he want?

468
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,867
Wants to hit me and save the girl?

469
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,280
Ask him to come

470
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
Go on

471
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,720
No!

472
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:57,985
-Sir, I've got all her details
-Tell me

473
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,410
Her name is Shakeela

474
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,201
Works in a beauty salon
She's from Trichy

475
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,480
Doesn't have a father
Mother lives in their hometown

476
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,019
She's been living
here for 7-8 years now

477
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:06,804
Where?

478
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:08,549
Mother Teresa
Working Women's Hostel

479
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:09,774
Room number 407

480
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,911
She looks like

481
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:12,151
It's 401

482
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:13,816
IT'S 4-0-1!

483
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:15,576
Is it '1'?

484
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:17,566
Make this girl shut up

485
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:19,682
Sorry, Brother just missed a line

486
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:23,867
What if someone missed
a line while shaving your neck?

487
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:27,255
This is an important job
Don't know if you can do it

488
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,240
-What needs to be done?
-Need to kidnap that girl

489
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:33,345
The girl needs to
reach here by the 23rd

490
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,600
Your salary will be ten million

491
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:40,284
Okay, brother

492
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:43,147
-The girl should be safe
-I'll make sure!

493
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:44,372
Be careful

494
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:50,514
Guys, where are you?
Where is everyone?

495
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,179
We've hit a jackpot!

496
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,370
Morning, sir!

497
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,240
6 to 8 are auspicious hours today

498
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,280
So I came early

499
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,120
S. Saravanan!

500
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,560
PR

501
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Priya!

502
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,400
Sha Kee

503
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,120
Get in

504
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,520
Be careful

505
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,576
Don't worry!

506
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:29,281
I was talking to him

507
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,560
God, I hope everything goes well

508
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,080
What?

509
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,400
You'll be driving the car...not God

510
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,880
Okay, shall we start?

511
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,600
Take a look at these three mirrors

512
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,120
This is the triangle of driving

513
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,520
Golden!

514
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,200
Golden triangle of driving

515
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,560
We must always pay attention to it

516
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,720
Okay?

517
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Similarly, this is the ABC of driving

518
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,480
Accelerator...Brake

519
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,920
Clutch

520
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,874
Must bring it to neutral

521
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:09,619
Safety first!

522
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,920
Put on your seatbelts

523
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,240
Then

524
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,480
Press the accelerator very,
very gently

525
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,600
And when it starts moving

526
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,400
Use the same leg for
brake and accelerator

527
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,040
If the Instructor says to stop the car,
you must turn on the indicator

528
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,320
And then bring your hand here

529
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,960
And then slowly brake

530
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,960
Oh no!

531
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,080
You hit the brakes and stop

532
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,120
-Thank you
-Shall we start?

533
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,240
Should I put on the hand brake?

534
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,120
Turn off your mouth
and turn on the ignition

535
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,520
Actually, sir

536
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,320
It's enough if I can
drive like you do

537
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,560
By when can you teach me that?

538
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,640
The others have paid, too!
You do all the talking

539
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,880
-What?
-Be quiet

540
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,680
Why do you get worked up?
We're here to learn

541
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,200
Don't ask me...Ask her

542
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,120
He keeps putting me down
How can I do it?

543
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,920
A teacher should give extra
attention to weak students!

544
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
She honks even at speed breakers!

545
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,720
You said to honk
if something comes in the way

546
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,200
Speed breakers can't hear, ma'am

547
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,520
Listen, I can teach anything
But I can't teach her driving

548
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,400
I can't cook! Teach me to cook?

549
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,040
Should have run you
over with the car

550
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,680
Named after director Mani Ratnam
But such loud dialogues!

551
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,360
I thought his name
was Sunil Gavaskar?

552
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,960
-Just do this for me, dear
-No way!

553
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,800
He's just a driver
Shows off like he's a pilot

554
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,120
Get going, 'di'

555
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,240
Did you just call me 'di'?

556
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,320
Talk to me like that again,
I'll turn your face around

557
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,680
Let it go, sis

558
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,920
If you call me 'di',
I'll call you 'da'

559
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
I've paid 3,500 rupees

560
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
If you won't teach me,
let's go to court now

561
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,520
To run and hide in
your house on the way?

562
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,680
WHERE IS MY CAR?

563
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,160
Why are you looking up?

564
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,000
Who parked the car up there?

565
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,520
He asked me to start
the car and switch gears

566
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,480
I switched gears before starting

567
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,520
This is the first and last time

568
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,080
Your wrecked my car!
Now you act like a schoolgirl?

569
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,000
That car was my family's legacy!

570
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,240
I will take you to court

571
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,320
Sir, don't get mad
You took my money

572
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Now get me a license

573
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,240
You gave me your word
You said 100% pass

574
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,520
Is that it?

575
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,600
Okay

576
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,240
I'll even beg the RTO
to get her a license

577
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,120
Just don't ask me
to teach driving

578
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,160
Okay

579
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,920
-I like this deal
-What deal?

580
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,960
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow

581
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,520
Bye!

582
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,920
That's a fancy number!

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,880
Actor Ajith used this
car in the movie 'Billa'

584
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,800
Really? Cool
So the cops will go after Billa

585
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,480
Remove it
Good job on the car

586
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,240
We'll kidnap the girl in this car

587
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,280
Our lives are set after this job

588
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,880
-What's with the new coat?
-Cost me 7,500

589
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,080
-That feels tough
-I've been working out

590
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,080
That's so unnecessary
All you need is a small surgery

591
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,040
You're always taking notes

592
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,480
What's your ambition?

593
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,320
I want to learn the trade from you,
and become a great gangster!

594
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,520
Really?

595
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,880
Then I'll become a politician
And enter the field of cinema!

596
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,080
-You want to become an actor?
-No, a producer

597
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,560
Producer?

598
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,240
My prayers are with you

599
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,120
I'll be driving...not God

600
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,480
What's with the green clothes?

601
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm going on a date...with my guy

602
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,960
Look over there

603
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,600
How is that?

604
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,480
Bye, sis...I'll share
pictures on WhatsApp

605
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
Hi!

606
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,120
Looks like Mani Ratnam is still angry

607
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,680
-Morning, sir!
-That's a big note

608
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:02,385
That's my girl

609
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,200
Your girl? You're in love?

610
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:07,025
Yes, one-sided, though

611
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,370
-What?
-I don't

612
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,804
-But she likes me
-Doesn't matter

613
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,709
I'll give her a license
if she passes the test

614
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,654
-That's not her thing
-What?

615
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:17,206
I mean, it's a Tuesday
Not her day

616
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:20,111
Let her drive on Wednesday,
then I'll give her the license

617
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:21,485
Sir! Officer

618
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,350
Why...?

619
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:24,215
-Manikandan sir?
-That's me

620
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:26,021
You're right

621
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,966
I'll clear the test
and collect my license

622
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,711
She's creating a scene!

623
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:31,134
What scene?

624
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,839
What a drama queen!

625
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:34,871
Look, sir
My poor mother

626
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:37,662
She is a housemaid
She's struggling every day

627
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:39,527
Her daughter has attained
a marriageable age

628
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:41,703
I must get a license, find a job

629
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:44,766
Earn some money and
buy gold for her wedding

630
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,966
-Poor thing!
-You have a sister?

631
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:48,231
No, I'm the only daughter

632
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,136
I was talking about me

633
00:37:50,598 --> 00:37:53,558
Look, sir I believe in hard work

634
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,861
-So I will drive now
-Correct

635
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:58,199
She wants to work hard

636
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:00,061
-Let's go?
-Let's go

637
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,740
He's a goner

638
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:03,685
Drive straight towards me

639
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,221
-I'll give you a license
-Okay sir

640
00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:07,966
She's an expert at running over
He's her target now!

641
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:11,996
What?

642
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,479
Shakeela!

643
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,350
How did you know my name?

644
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,775
The accident last week...

645
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,920
...at the Nungambakkam
Road Transport Officer Office?

646
00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:24,473
He's admitted in the hospital now

647
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:25,898
Room 402

648
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:28,429
I sent him a bouquet

649
00:38:28,454 --> 00:38:31,054
Not a bouquet
It was a funeral wreath!

650
00:38:31,214 --> 00:38:32,614
He's not coming back

651
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:36,982
Shakeela, do you know
how to reverse?

652
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:38,767
That's really easy

653
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:42,368
Just back up 5 meters
Or even 5 feet

654
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:43,944
I'll issue your license

655
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,591
Okay, sir

656
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:46,496
Let's go!

657
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,319
I want to take one
last look at that guy

658
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:50,734
I'm ready

659
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,121
Hello!

660
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:03,325
Oh no

661
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,910
I switched to the first
gear instead of reverse

662
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,213
Manikandan sir!

663
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:10,274
Oh no!

664
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:13,298
Thank god, the helmet is okay

665
00:39:13,323 --> 00:39:15,243
What a girl!

666
00:39:15,268 --> 00:39:19,388
She sent the Road Transport Officer
on his final road trip

667
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,780
There's the Ladies' Hostel

668
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:25,605
Yeah, it's there to my left

669
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,948
The main road is right here

670
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,480
Yes

671
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:37,938
No, it's quiet here

672
00:39:38,197 --> 00:39:39,677
Yeah, okay

673
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,000
The road looks empty

674
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm near the cemetery

675
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,870
-That's the girl?
-Yes

676
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:50,531
She looks average
Why is she worth 10 million?

677
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,916
Just do your job, get your money

678
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:55,343
-Shut up, now
-You said it, brother!

679
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,038
Stay on the line, brother

680
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,935
Madam, do you know this address?

681
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:00,189
Show me

682
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:01,461
All okay here

683
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,720
Dubai Cross street?

684
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,760
I don't know the address
Tell me one more time?

685
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,840
Yes, I did straight and left

686
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm here at the place

687
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,760
-Yes, brother?
-Very good, man

688
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,800
No issues?

689
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,400
No issues, brother
Where to bring her?

690
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,360
Who is bringing her?

691
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,160
Billy

692
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,360
The one who got the package
from Kolkata last time

693
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,920
That guy!

694
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,680
Give Billy my number

695
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,520
He needs to come to Mussoorie,
Uttarakhand

696
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,840
He must call me once
every three hours

697
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
-Okay, brother
-At any cost

698
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,494
I'll take care

699
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,471
-I want the girl here by the 23rd
-Okay, brother

700
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:14,176
If you fail,
you shall die on the 24th

701
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,760
What?

702
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,520
Got it?

703
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,120
What was that noise?

704
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,145
It's nothing
Everything's okay

705
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,200
Take care!

706
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,920
-Text me Billy's number
-Okay, brother

707
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,280
It's the cops, brother

708
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,080
The windows are tinted
They can't see us

709
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,280
Lift her!
Into the trunk

710
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,600
Cover her with something
Quick!

711
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,600
Won't stop the car?

712
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,600
Be quiet, I'll deal with it

713
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,640
Roll down the windows
Down, I say

714
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,393
How I help you?

715
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,298
Why did you take the keys?

716
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,160
Hello, Traffic Control room...over!

717
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:54,625
Traffic Control South 22
We've seized the vehicle

718
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,330
Sir

719
00:41:55,355 --> 00:41:56,875
It's the one we were looking for

720
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,300
Sir, listen to me

721
00:41:58,398 --> 00:42:01,118
He sped away in Mylapore
We've caught him at Nandanam junction

722
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:02,364
Send for the tow vehicle

723
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:05,749
You refuse to stop the vehicle,
and now you're arguing with a cop?

724
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,680
What's funny?

725
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:09,105
You chased us for this?

726
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,290
We're toiling under the sun
and you break the rules

727
00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:13,755
And speed away in an imported,
air conditioned car?

728
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,460
It's not imported, just painted!
Who said it's imported?

729
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,244
Sir, we know the Commissioner

730
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,389
What's his name?

731
00:42:19,492 --> 00:42:21,532
-I think it's Walter Vetrivel
-Listen

732
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,595
Come straight to the
Commissioner's office

733
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,194
Pay the fine, learn his name,
and then take your car

734
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:27,499
Officer, please

735
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:29,209
I said I'll deal with it!

736
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,114
Who asked you to talk
about the Commissioner?

737
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:32,979
-Get out of here!
-Let's go

738
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:35,387
Where are you taking my car?
Stop...stop

739
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:37,763
-I said stop
-You deal with the Officer

740
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,241
The girl is in the trunk

741
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,026
-Make the call
-Call who?

742
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:43,851
That guy, what's his name

743
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,200
Hello, Bond?

744
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,520
Called me first thing
in the morning

745
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,320
-Who?
-Shakeela

746
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:01,145
Daughter of Jyothi

747
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:02,495
What does she want?

748
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
She wants a refund
'Cause we didn't get her license

749
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
The fool wants her money back

750
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,520
She's no fool!
You're wrong, Boss

751
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,600
She speaks to the point

752
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,160
Why are you staring
at that vehicle?

753
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,600
See that blue car?
There's a small job

754
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,640
Totally 6 cars

755
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,120
It's in the middle

756
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,480
It's parked wrong side

757
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,680
Okay

758
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,040
'The Earth rotates around it's
own axis and revolves around the Sun'

759
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,800
I remember my geography now

760
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,185
-Brother?
-Bond!

761
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,690
The vehicle is up on the first floor!

762
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:47,155
What?
The first floor!

763
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,080
The car is not registered
Nor insured

764
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,665
Don't let the cops get to it

765
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,410
There's a package
worth 10 million!

766
00:43:53,435 --> 00:43:54,755
Commissioner Office?
How far?

767
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,420
"One plus one is two
Two plus one is three"

768
00:43:57,445 --> 00:44:00,925
"Inside three it is four
Four, five, six"

769
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:02,483
What are you going to do?

770
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:04,388
See that blue car?
We're picking it up

771
00:44:04,413 --> 00:44:06,533
You make it sound like
picking up clothes on discount

772
00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:08,038
How many signals in this route?

773
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:10,876
A police booth here
One way traffic on the left

774
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:13,502
And a bridge over here

775
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:16,625
"This hunting is for killing"

776
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,090
"The den of tiger"

777
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,355
"Will he cross the gate?"

778
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,820
"You change your route"

779
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,103
"The jungle of lion"

780
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:23,841
"If that one goat..."

781
00:44:23,866 --> 00:44:25,266
"You try to steal"

782
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,291
"You won't cross the border"

783
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:31,267
"Before counting ten..."

784
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,200
"Before counting ten..."

785
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:05,575
"On seeing he looks young"

786
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,880
"Go carefully brother"

787
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,840
"Don't touch
the electricity charged wire"

788
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,400
"He can face anyone single handedly"

789
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,840
"A vehicle without brake"

790
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,720
"If you come nearby, it'll bang"

791
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,520
"There is no match to him"

792
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,040
"He'll overcome you"

793
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,240
"Hey, six rivers, seven mountains..."

794
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,240
"He'll come around
all eight directions"

795
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,120
"Before counting ten..."

796
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,840
"Before counting ten..."

797
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,720
"Before counting ten..."

798
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,640
"Before counting ten..."

799
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,200
"Before counting ten..."

800
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,200
Bond!

801
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,240
Brother, I've got the car

802
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,200
You're James Bond, alright I knew it

803
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,800
I'll bring it to the garage?

804
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,400
No, no, no

805
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,400
No, we've given this
address to the cops

806
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,800
Where are you now?

807
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,200
Pallavaram Railway Station

808
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,080
I hear the police siren

809
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,520
-Just a lone cop
-Is he following you?

810
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,320
Working hard for his measly salary!

811
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,200
In that case take the national highway
to the State of Andhra Pradhesh

812
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,680
-We can't have cops at our tail
-Brother, you said it's a quickie

813
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,040
No way!

814
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,280
Listen to me

815
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,440
I'm wearing my shorts now

816
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:13,545
You look great!

817
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,490
No way

818
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:16,675
The siren is getting louder
Why did you stop?

819
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,720
Send someone else to pick up the car

820
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,960
The package is in the car!
We're dead men if

821
00:46:20,985 --> 00:46:22,105
I have other work, brother

822
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,570
I was going to send Billy,
but there was this incident

823
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,960
Look, there's no fuel!
You just don't listen

824
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,785
There's money on
the dashboard, take it

825
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,610
-I have work to do now
-What do you want?

826
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,480
I don't want it

827
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:35,785
-I'll give you fifteen
-Fifteen?

828
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,130
Why are you laughing?

829
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:37,772
Hi!

830
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:39,717
It needs to reach Mussoorie
Take it there

831
00:46:39,827 --> 00:46:41,347
-Mussoorie
-Get down

832
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,760
How far?

833
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,320
Stop

834
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,735
Your voicemail was
in Telugu language

835
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,320
What's this place?

836
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:09,425
This place is my owner's property

837
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,720
Being cocky?

838
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,000
You caught me

839
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,840
Tell me, what is this place?

840
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,345
This is Renigunta

841
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,480
Boss, I'm on a delivery job
I'll be back in two days

842
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,360
You're taking the car
we just snatched?

843
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,600
Yes

844
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,280
They've offered fifteen grand

845
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:25,225
I'll get it done

846
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,410
Wow Fifteen?
What's so special about that car?

847
00:47:27,435 --> 00:47:29,555
They're the kind who
smuggle diamonds in car tyres

848
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,820
I'll just do my job

849
00:47:30,845 --> 00:47:32,725
You've snatched it
from the cops, be careful

850
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:33,777
Okay

851
00:47:33,802 --> 00:47:34,682
Sir?

852
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:36,587
Fill up the tank for 500 rupees

853
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,240
Full tank for 500?

854
00:47:38,265 --> 00:47:40,345
My battery is dying

855
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:42,415
I'll finish my job and call you

856
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,280
Oh! He meant 5 of those 500s

857
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,520
Sir, got some water to drink?

858
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,280
There's a motel right there

859
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,760
You'll find something
hot and spicy to eat

860
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,480
Check the air, too

861
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,520
Okay

862
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,600
There's a girl in the motel
Watch out for that one

863
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,240
She'll strip your shirt away

864
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,720
Escape!

865
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,080
-What happened?
-Sorry!

866
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,720
The food wasn't good?

867
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,360
Much worse

868
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,960
Much worse?

869
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,160
Just don't sing

870
00:48:08,193 --> 00:48:09,473
Why is he running so fast?

871
00:48:09,498 --> 00:48:10,738
Madam

872
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:13,987
Hello?

873
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,800
Excuse me

874
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,320
Okay

875
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,640
No one seems to care!

876
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:36,909
I'm the one who
swallowed the ghost itself

877
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:49,283
"I must drive vehicle
and go far away"

878
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,250
"I'm extremely hungry here"

879
00:48:57,364 --> 00:49:05,044
"Get something hot
and spicy fast"

880
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:09,605
"Hot and spicy
hot and spicy"

881
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,910
"Poor fellow
He has got trapped"

882
00:49:12,935 --> 00:49:16,295
"Why do you want to do
unnecessary acts, dear?"

883
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,680
"You are stepping into danger,
are you crazy?"

884
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,680
"Now also you can run away"

885
00:49:22,705 --> 00:49:26,985
"Else become a member
in our association"

886
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,080
You wanted spicy?
Eat it

887
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,160
It was hot, alright

888
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:39,985
But where's the spice?

889
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,600
Look over there

890
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,280
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

891
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,080
"I'm a hot spicy chilli"

892
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,120
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

893
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,080
"I'm a beauty who'll charm anyone"

894
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:16,616
"Just by seeing me saliva
will drip from mouth"

895
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,000
"If you touch me with mouth
tears will come out of eyes"

896
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,520
"All the guys are just useless"

897
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,000
"They are the beeda chewed
and spit by girls"

898
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:29,585
"The tongue has become red"

899
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,080
Eat the chilli and you win

900
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,040
Good luck, gentleman

901
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,680
Watch now

902
00:50:37,464 --> 00:50:40,344
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

903
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,160
"Has he come to control you all?"

904
00:50:44,185 --> 00:50:47,305
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

905
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,050
"Has he come to free us?"

906
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,080
Second round!

907
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,680
Those are the rules

908
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,280
-Really?
-Yes!

909
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,760
Super!

910
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,920
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

911
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,400
"She is a candle that will melt in fire"

912
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,920
Nobody here?

913
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,400
Saw that? He's got
a foreign car and everything

914
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,800
It's not imported, man
It's been altered

915
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,280
It's cash!

916
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,760
Come, look here

917
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,240
These are the gun's spare parts

918
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,360
The person who assembles it first,
wins the bullet to shoot

919
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,520
Time starts now!

920
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:40,200
"Where has he come from?
Has he come to love you?"

921
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,680
"Fix it fast Tighten the screws
Assemble it fast and win over her"

922
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,120
"He is mess up and
do something"

923
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,880
What has happened this?
Who fired the bullet?

924
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,760
Is she dead?
You have won

925
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,840
-I won't agree
-I will kill you

926
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,040
She looks like a muffin!
Wake up, sweetheart

927
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,760
First I found a phone, then cash
And now a girl!

928
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,440
Let me go first, please?

929
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,480
I'll make it quick

930
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:22,545
You only saw her first

931
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,720
Brother is on the way

932
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,360
No way!

933
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,080
You can't always have it your way

934
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,360
Let me go first this time

935
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,720
I'll go first

936
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,520
Selvam! Catch her

937
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:43,080
"He is attacking me
with bullet less gun"

938
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,000
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

939
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,720
"This Sultana is born to win"

940
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,800
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

941
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,600
"Masatana has come to charm me"

942
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,280
"Without knowing about
you I asked for address"

943
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,600
"Without finishing the game I lost to you"

944
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,160
"It is my pass time
to take others for ride"

945
00:54:11,287 --> 00:54:14,447
"You made me flat,
lift up your collar"

946
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,800
"You are the talk of the town"

947
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,720
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

948
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,040
"Is he the head for everyone?"

949
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,400
"Gaana...Gaana Telanganaa..."

950
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,160
Why is she getting into
the same car she came in?

951
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,480
"Has he come to free us"

952
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,640
And they say I am crazy!

953
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,160
She came this side

954
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,280
Hey, where have you gone?

955
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,280
The fuel station, brother

956
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,680
I thought they'd strip you,
but you ended up making them strip!

957
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,200
Mani Ratnam!

958
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,200
-Try that the next time
-Okay, I'll be back

959
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,080
Look over there

960
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,880
A blue car is coming
to your way, stop it

961
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,240
Hey!

962
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,720
Look at that!

963
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,040
The chick is in the car

964
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,480
Gentlemen, excuse me

965
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,040
-What is this?
-First, come outside

966
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,680
Don't touch the car

967
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,400
You're a fraud yourself,
and you're telling us?

968
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,640
Who, me?

969
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,840
Just come out!

970
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,080
-Running away?
-Hey, loose

971
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,920
Hi, sir

972
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,465
What are you doing
in the car, fool?

973
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,050
They chased me, I didn't
know it was your car I hid inside

974
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:25,875
Sir!
Mani Ratnam, sir!

975
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:27,443
-What?
-Save me

976
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,640
That's not me

977
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:31,105
The car is okay I am off!

978
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:31,675
Just move!

979
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,220
If they'd touched my car
that's a different story

980
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,880
You don't know this guy at all

981
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,640
You don't know what
he can do once he's angry

982
00:55:42,665 --> 00:55:43,905
Idiot, get down

983
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,410
-Dare to touch me now?
-Get down

984
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:46,715
Come on, come on

985
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:48,778
-Be quiet, idiot
-I'm warning you

986
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,320
Not to save myself

987
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,440
But to save you from him

988
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,880
Brother, punch her in the mouth

989
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,840
What's this?

990
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,120
She's getting rescued
by her kidnapper!

991
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:00,265
Sir! Leave the weapons in the car

992
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,730
-Weapons?
-Don't get mad

993
00:56:02,755 --> 00:56:03,635
Hello

994
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:04,812
Dare to touch now?

995
00:56:04,837 --> 00:56:06,357
Get down

996
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,203
You...?

997
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,575
You don't always
get to block the way

998
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,240
10 20 30 40

999
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,280
He says he'll knock down
one man before the count of ten

1000
00:56:57,305 --> 00:56:58,905
So you do the math

1001
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,770
-He is some hero, huh?
-When did I say that?

1002
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,330
You can't do all the talking

1003
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:04,715
Let me talk, too

1004
00:57:04,764 --> 00:57:06,084
Hello! One minute

1005
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,796
You've smashed the headlights

1006
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,360
Pay 10 bucks each for the bulb,
I'll be on my way

1007
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,345
I have nothing to do with the girl

1008
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,730
I'm telling you-

1009
00:57:13,755 --> 00:57:15,555
9-Aug

1010
00:57:15,784 --> 00:57:17,184
Sir, make him understand

1011
00:57:17,209 --> 00:57:19,169
Just smash him

1012
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,520
It's gone

1013
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:26,705
-Time for a catch punch?
-Say it

1014
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,720
You smashed his bulb,
he smashed yours!

1015
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,280
Go...go

1016
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,480
You know each other?

1017
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,440
Yes, quite well

1018
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,520
-Now I get it
-Get what?

1019
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,400
You and him are

1020
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,280
He's looking!

1021
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,320
Hey, hit me

1022
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,240
Count to ten now

1023
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,840

1024
1023
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,400
No, small-

1025
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,320

1026
1025
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,840

1027
1026
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,480
No, please don't

1028
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,520

1029
1028
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,400
Sir, be patient
Let's talk it out

1030
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,840
I'll count for you

1031
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,760
7, 8, 9,10

1032
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,440
Hey, where is Mussoorie?

1033
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,880
About 3500 kms from here, brother

1034
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,280
It will take three days to reach?

1035
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,905
But our man will
get there in two days

1036
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,160
He doesn't know the girl
is in the trunk right?

1037
00:59:39,185 --> 00:59:40,585
-Okay, call him up
-Okay, brother

1038
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,690
Call for you

1039
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,920
-Hello?
-Billy?

1040
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:44,985
You son of a

1041
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:46,610
Pass the phone to Dass

1042
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,160
Who is it?

1043
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,320
Hello!

1044
00:59:49,345 --> 00:59:51,305
Dass, what are you doing?

1045
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,210
The car should have
left two hours back

1046
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,960
But Billy is answering the landline!

1047
00:59:54,985 --> 00:59:57,105
-What's going on there?
-I've sent another man

1048
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,160
Who gave you the rights
to change the driver?

1049
00:59:59,185 --> 01:00:00,985
He takes two days where
other will take three

1050
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,320
He's superb, brother

1051
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:03,825
-What's his name?
-James Bond

1052
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,490
Dass, are you kidding me?

1053
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:06,691
Isn't it Sunil Gavaskar?

1054
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,970
-He said Michael Jackson
-No, Mike Tyson?

1055
01:00:08,995 --> 01:00:10,275
Well, its

1056
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:12,154
Give me his phone number

1057
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,360
It's 95

1058
01:00:13,385 --> 01:00:14,945

1059
1058
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:15,770

1060
1059
01:00:15,843 --> 01:00:16,683

1061
1060
01:00:16,935 --> 01:00:17,535

1062
1061
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,760
0-0-4

1063
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:20,105
Dial this number

1064
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:22,971
Call him, quick...quick
Before Pooran Singh calls him

1065
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:24,099
Quick, call him

1066
01:00:25,545 --> 01:00:26,905
Who is calling?

1067
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,520
-Hello!
-I am Dass

1068
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,040
Dass the electrician?

1069
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,760
My fuse is blown

1070
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:33,255
Can you fix it?

1071
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,960
-It's not broken
-The girl?

1072
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,320
She went with the driver

1073
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,000
The kidnapper is the rescuer?
I don't even understand this plot!

1074
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,600
-Hang up, man
-Hello?

1075
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,160
What's happening?

1076
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,960
-Hello, Bond?
-Hello?

1077
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,440
Who are you, Sir?

1078
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,160
This is Pooran Singh
Who are you?

1079
01:00:49,185 --> 01:00:50,665
You're Poor and you Sing?

1080
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:51,938
Where's the girl?

1081
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,000
You can ask me
in Hindi or Tamil

1082
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,120
The girl is gone
You understand?

1083
01:00:56,145 --> 01:00:57,545
What's he blabbering?

1084
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,130
Hey, switch off the phone

1085
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,480
Hello?

1086
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:01,505
Hello?

1087
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,120
It was busy a while back,
and now it's switched off!

1088
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:11,265
What's happening?!

1089
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,600
Son of a

1090
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,720
Come here!

1091
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:18,425
Something's wrong
Dass is not answering the phone

1092
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,920
You start immediately

1093
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,480
Everyone in
Billy, something's not right

1094
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:24,625
You go in the same route
I'll call you back

1095
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,880
One second

1096
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:27,985
Blade, go with him

1097
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,440
-Ajay
-Bro!

1098
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,760
-We have to get this right
-Don't worry

1099
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,960
Massacre in Uttarakhand

1100
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,520
Death penalty for
the killer of 40 people

1101
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:51,695
Don't know why they
tried to kidnap me

1102
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,680
Look, I'm travelling
on an important task

1103
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,040
You can't tag along

1104
01:01:56,065 --> 01:01:58,905
I've got an important job, too
I can't go with you, either

1105
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,290
Drop me at a phone booth

1106
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,120
Would the girl be conscious now?

1107
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,400
Of course
It's been hours now

1108
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,640
James Bond was her
driving instructor

1109
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,800
You're telling me now?
They knew each other already!

1110
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:22,185
You ran the background check

1111
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,250
Hit you

1112
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:24,618
Idiot!

1113
01:02:24,643 --> 01:02:28,243
We've filled their tank, given him a bundle
of money and sent them on a fun trip

1114
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,200
So I'm a pimp here?

1115
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,019
Billy?

1116
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,164
The girl had regained consciousness
The two had left together

1117
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,720
Billy

1118
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,600
Kill him

1119
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,425
Then you drop the girl

1120
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,040
Bring me good news
after delivering her!

1121
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,160
Go now

1122
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,000
Boy! Look for Pajero
320 headlights

1123
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,027
What?

1124
01:03:04,052 --> 01:03:07,572
There's a bus to Chennai from here
But money for ticket

1125
01:03:11,695 --> 01:03:13,975
Think I'm a beggar?

1126
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,200
Return my money

1127
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,360
What?
Your money?

1128
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,520
What money?

1129
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,520
You took my money
But you didn't get me a license

1130
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,760
Nor did you teach me driving
I paid 3500 as single payment

1131
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,520
Give it back to me
Return it!

1132
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,120
Shouldn't have picked
her up in my car

1133
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,680
I didn't need your car

1134
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,640
Here
Brat

1135
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,720
Hello?

1136
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,640
Hello, ATM?
This is Shakeela

1137
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,720
Where did you go, sis?

1138
01:03:37,745 --> 01:03:40,905
I was kidnapped by four men
They tried to misbehave

1139
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,600
Really? I'll come join you

1140
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,545
We'll have fun

1141
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,570
Your stories won't work with me

1142
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,666
You're loafing around
with your hostel rent due!

1143
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,920
Look, it'll take me a day
or two to get back

1144
01:03:50,945 --> 01:03:52,825
-Don't wait up
-Where are you going?

1145
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,946
Going on an important
mission to Mussoorie

1146
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:56,059
With the instructor

1147
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:59,044
Who? That foul-mouth
from the driving school?

1148
01:03:59,218 --> 01:04:02,938
-Don't talk about him like that
-Looks like you're switching lanes

1149
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,480
-No such thing
-Don't feel shy

1150
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:06,585
Listen

1151
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,480
I'll be back in a few days
Don't look for me

1152
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:09,505
The hostel rent?

1153
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,050
I can't hear you
I call you back

1154
01:04:11,075 --> 01:04:11,955
Sis!

1155
01:04:12,177 --> 01:04:13,217
Hello?

1156
01:04:13,242 --> 01:04:16,802
"You are the talk of the town now"

1157
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,000
Oh no!

1158
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,920
Sir

1159
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:24,105
You can't drive in
the hills without headlights

1160
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:26,095
Give me money to buy a new bulb

1161
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,190
-One minute
-Make it quick

1162
01:04:28,215 --> 01:04:30,975
I gave her all my money
And fought with her, too

1163
01:04:31,382 --> 01:04:35,102
Only way out is the
mother tongue we share

1164
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,120
You Tamil Me Tamil
Why fighting?

1165
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,600
What?

1166
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:42,828
I thought about it

1167
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,960
You keep the money

1168
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,840
Teach me driving

1169
01:04:47,855 --> 01:04:49,614
This is even worse

1170
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:51,119
I'll come with you

1171
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,680
No I need to travel far

1172
01:04:53,775 --> 01:04:55,015
It'll take me three days

1173
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,743
You can teach me in two days

1174
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,480
-I'll manage
-Two days, huh?

1175
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:02,334
'Same time at Uttarakhand'

1176
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,640
-What are you doing?
-I'm studying, mom

1177
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:12,272
Okay, eat up

1178
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,600
And this is your target

1179
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,920
What's this?

1180
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,356
This is the safety lock

1181
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,720
This is called trigger

1182
01:05:39,745 --> 01:05:40,865
Got it?

1183
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:41,690
Trigger!

1184
01:05:41,715 --> 01:05:43,995
If you pull the trigger,
it fires a bullet

1185
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,822
And this is how you aim

1186
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:49,549
When you pull

1187
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:51,454
No! You have to take aim

1188
01:05:51,613 --> 01:05:54,213
Aim for your target,
and pull the trigger

1189
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:58,710
Don't hurt my daddy!

1190
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:00,295
Spare my child

1191
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,840
You can kill me

1192
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,520
Off target by a little

1193
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,990
Need to waste another bullet now

1194
01:06:09,956 --> 01:06:12,276
Don't hurt my daddy

1195
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:23,550
We should have killed these
two along with those forty

1196
01:06:23,575 --> 01:06:25,575
They need to be nipped at the bud

1197
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,360
No one left to sprout now

1198
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,840
Want me to sleep here?

1199
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:48,680
No, I'll sleep here

1200
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:52,265
You get a room at a five
star or a three star hotel

1201
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,650
Pest!

1202
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,240
I'm worried about the bulb
not getting fixed till morning

1203
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,080
And you're nagging me

1204
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,480
Don't have any money

1205
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,200
What?

1206
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,360
I'm hungry

1207
01:07:05,385 --> 01:07:06,905
Because the alarm went off?

1208
01:07:06,938 --> 01:07:09,218
No, the alarm went off
because I'm hungry

1209
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:10,243
God!

1210
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,440
You!

1211
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,160
They have kidnapped you...

1212
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,440
...but let free

1213
01:07:16,722 --> 01:07:17,815
I have to punish them

1214
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,200
You can't satisfy
a woman's hunger

1215
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:20,705
Call yourself a man?

1216
01:07:22,808 --> 01:07:24,040
Excuse me?

1217
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,170
Hunger!

1218
01:07:27,984 --> 01:07:30,744
Not that kind of hunger

1219
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:35,277
This is different

1220
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,327
What are you doing?

1221
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:47,990
Let me go!

1222
01:07:48,015 --> 01:07:49,335
Where is he?

1223
01:07:49,415 --> 01:07:51,095
He went to North India for your job

1224
01:07:51,215 --> 01:07:52,575
Does he have any family?

1225
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,720
Tell me

1226
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,600
Mother?
Father?

1227
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,840
Or a sister?

1228
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,000
Brother, look at this cover

1229
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,720
What?

1230
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,440
I thought I saw a ghost

1231
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,040
Ghosts can't affect other ghosts

1232
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:11,615
You said you were hungry

1233
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,640
Here

1234
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,320
Idiot! Cost me two bucks

1235
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,000
Can't even eat a biscuit right?

1236
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,240
Sorry-

1237
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,800
Here

1238
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,200
Went out in the pouring
rain to get it

1239
01:08:39,225 --> 01:08:40,465
What a waste!

1240
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,680
When you get mad,
your eyes squinch

1241
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,200
It's nice

1242
01:08:48,055 --> 01:08:49,575
I'm cursing you here

1243
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,600
We're in North India
South Indian curses don't count

1244
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,320
Go on!

1245
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,080
What is this?
Tell me

1246
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,800
Whose medicines are these?

1247
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,160
-Tell me
-It's mine

1248
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,600
Then drink it!

1249
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,120
Is your name Nandini?

1250
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,400
Who is Nandini?

1251
01:09:19,775 --> 01:09:21,135
May you prosper!

1252
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,240
May your siblings attain
great heights and prosper

1253
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,240
You went in the dark all alone?

1254
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,680
Weren't you scared?

1255
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,800
Yeah, right

1256
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,320
I can tell by the way you drive

1257
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,280
You've never been
in an accident?

1258
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,280
They say you develop a fear
if you meet with an accident

1259
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,440
-But you are...
-Once

1260
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,320
Just once

1261
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,200
And after that one time

1262
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,200
I lost all fear

1263
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,160
Bus or auto?
What did you crash?

1264
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,040
Next time, call a cab

1265
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,200
Understand?

1266
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,800
I can't keep driving you around
Think I'm jobless?

1267
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,800
What are you doing?

1268
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,920
Gloves! I made it
myself in craft class

1269
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Put it on

1270
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,040
You said you felt discomfort
while driving, right?

1271
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,320
Thank you

1272
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,200
Who are you messaging this late?

1273
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,120
Not messaging
It's WhatsApp

1274
01:10:15,495 --> 01:10:17,895
Who is it?
That skinny boy?

1275
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,760
How do you know him?

1276
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,400
He's the one who 'likes'
all your lame Facebook pictures

1277
01:10:22,425 --> 01:10:24,625
Brother! Why are you going
through my Facebook page?

1278
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:26,175
I'm your older brother, 'di'

1279
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,520
Call me 'di' again,
I'll turn your face around

1280
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:33,455
Call me 'di'
and I'll call you 'da'

1281
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,680
I' m a major now

1282
01:10:34,705 --> 01:10:37,145
There's an hour to
go for your birthday

1283
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,290
Brother!
You remembered?

1284
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,080
Cake!

1285
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:46,480
-What?
-Wish me

1286
01:10:46,505 --> 01:10:50,105
Some guy would call you at 12,
and say he wanted to wish you first

1287
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,680
I don't want to compete with that

1288
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:55,021
What did you say?

1289
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,280
Here

1290
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,840
You brat!

1291
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,320
Head-

1292
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,160
It hurts, brother

1293
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,440
Brother, don't do-

1294
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
It's hurting, brother

1295
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,720
I should've be more careful

1296
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,520
It was my fault

1297
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,800
Excuse me!

1298
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,800
A few bills are pending

1299
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,000
Look at this, Mother

1300
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,480
Slept well?

1301
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,760
Yeah, we stayed up
late talking last night

1302
01:12:45,135 --> 01:12:46,415
Saw the keys?

1303
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,400
The keys?

1304
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,160
The driver always has the keys
Don't ask me

1305
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,680
Called me a driver?

1306
01:12:50,975 --> 01:12:53,895
One who drives the car is a driver

1307
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,760
Hey...shut up

1308
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,160
Men are always like this

1309
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,200
You misplace things around the house
and expect women to find them

1310
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,910
Women are always like this

1311
01:13:02,935 --> 01:13:05,615
You're all sweet in the night
and you sulk in the morning

1312
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,840
Go stuff yourself with food!

1313
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:13,335
Are Mr and Mrs
Mani Ratnam fighting

1314
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,760
Early morning

1315
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,280
Who said we're a couple?

1316
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,160
She told me you loved each other

1317
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,480
She's lying
I'm not Mani Ratnam

1318
01:13:20,505 --> 01:13:22,145
My name is Dass

1319
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,770
A.R.Muruga Dass

1320
01:13:24,682 --> 01:13:26,882
Oh darn!
It was in my pocket all along?

1321
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,960
I'll plant it on her
That's better

1322
01:13:33,775 --> 01:13:36,015
Give me the keys
We need to leave, it's late

1323
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,400
I told you to look in the car
I don't know

1324
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,880
Look in your pocket
It should be there

1325
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,320
I told you I don't have it

1326
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,080
Won't you look first?

1327
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,520
What are you doing?

1328
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,320
-Let me go!
-It's here

1329
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,880
What are you doing?

1330
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,000
Sorry

1331
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,280
By mistake-

1332
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,760
Your name suits you

1333
01:14:13,218 --> 01:14:14,858
How long will you take
to make a call?

1334
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,443
I called-

1335
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:28,360
"This kind of intoxication is
not good for you heart"

1336
01:14:29,192 --> 01:14:33,832
"Even on leaving it'll stand and smile
This craziness won't leave"

1337
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,840
I was hungry

1338
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,040
You went and ate without me?

1339
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:43,160
"The way I like, this world is
full of beauty in front of me"

1340
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,440
Fuel for 52 rupees and 50 paise!

1341
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,360
Don't answer!

1342
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,840
-Check the number
-It's STD call

1343
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,600
Must be Pooran Singh
I told you to switch off the phone!

1344
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:15,360
"Tell me why are you
dancing, heart?"

1345
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:22,160
"This kind of intoxication is
not good for you heart"

1346
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:29,200
"Even on leaving it'll stand and smile
This craziness won't leave"

1347
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,960
Ate something else without me?

1348
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,120
Get lost!

1349
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:37,160
"He is coming to steal the heart"

1350
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,640
"Put a piece of your shawl on me"

1351
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,240
Pandey
Chulbul Pandey

1352
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,040
Quality Inspector

1353
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,280
No sand in the fire buckets?

1354
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,840
Why is madam seated on the floor?
Get a chair, quick

1355
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,520
Nothing is in order here

1356
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,680
Okay, how much is it?

1357
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,280
Who're you trying to bribe?
I'm Chulbul Pandey!

1358
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,480
We'll be back

1359
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,120
"I'll remain beside you
I'll wonder seeing you"

1360
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,200
"Whether you say or not I'll stop"

1361
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,520
"Daily there is an auspicious sign
This is a new journey"

1362
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,320
"This path must take
me to my destination"

1363
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:37,480
"Whole my life I was alone"

1364
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:44,120
"This loneliness must end
You came for that..."

1365
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,600
Think that's funny?

1366
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,880
Brother, I've posted men
at all the toll gates on the way

1367
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,360
They haven't crossed the town

1368
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,120
They've crossed this toll gate

1369
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,240
We're checking each
and every toll gate

1370
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,840
-The tank is empty
-Yes, it's empty

1371
01:17:05,865 --> 01:17:06,945
Pocket is empty, too

1372
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:07,930
I'm starving

1373
01:17:07,955 --> 01:17:08,755
Me too

1374
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:10,764
What to do now, Mani Ratnam sir?

1375
01:17:10,953 --> 01:17:11,593
Nope

1376
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,200
Hood

1377
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,040
Robin Hood

1378
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,640
We take what we need

1379
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,480
You're saying we steal?

1380
01:17:20,505 --> 01:17:24,585
"When there I'll glare
It is like sun light inside rain"

1381
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:28,770
"Even if I go, don't go
I'm telling you"

1382
01:17:28,795 --> 01:17:32,795
"It is possible to fly high
I'll continue and finish this"

1383
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:36,556
"You don't change I have changed"

1384
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,040
"There is no water inside moon"

1385
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,040
"See the moon that sleeps in water"

1386
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:57,040
"This kind of intoxication is not
good for you heart"

1387
01:17:57,065 --> 01:17:58,425
Why did you stop the car?

1388
01:17:58,450 --> 01:17:59,930
Shut up, you nag

1389
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,800
They're checking all the cars

1390
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:16,160
"The way I like, this world is
full of beauty in front of me"

1391
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,840
Your son is kicking my tummy!

1392
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,880
My baby!

1393
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,600
"Tell me why are you dancing heart?"

1394
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,600
Catch! Go rock it in a cradle

1395
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,800
Excuse me?

1396
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,760
Need details of this car

1397
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,400
Thank you very much

1398
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,520
Brother, found the car

1399
01:18:57,545 --> 01:18:58,345
Yes!

1400
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,400
It crossed Toll 69
at 10 o clock this morning

1401
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,760
One second, brother

1402
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,480
Why are you standing here?

1403
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,480
Sir, please wait

1404
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,400
Just come this way I'll explain

1405
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,320
-Let me go!
-There is no problem

1406
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,640
Brother, it's been 4 hours
since the car crossed Toll 69

1407
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,225
It's not crossed Toll 70 yet

1408
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,770
So it's somewhere within this radius

1409
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:18,275
I've stationed men at both the tolls

1410
01:19:18,371 --> 01:19:19,891
We can get them soon

1411
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,520
We run inside by the count to ten!

1412
01:19:27,545 --> 01:19:28,745
Okay!

1413
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,040
10!

1414
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,720
You finish everything
before the count of ten?

1415
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,400
What is it?

1416
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,440
A room

1417
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,865
Just for the night?

1418
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,250
-Name?
-Khan

1419
01:19:42,275 --> 01:19:43,235
Khan what?

1420
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,160
It's just Khan

1421
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,520
No one gives their real name anyway

1422
01:19:48,795 --> 01:19:51,115
Two people
One key?

1423
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,400
No, separate ones

1424
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,880
Thank you

1425
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,800
Let's go?

1426
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,760
He doesn't even think
of me as a woman

1427
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,320
Asked for two rooms

1428
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,600
So insulting!

1429
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,080
I knew it

1430
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,920
What?

1431
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,480
Madam, water?

1432
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,920
Thanks

1433
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,720
So spoilt!

1434
01:20:29,374 --> 01:20:34,014
Not a penny in his hands,
but he wants his own room!

1435
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,320
You have the keys, right?

1436
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,840
Shall I take them?

1437
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,480
I won't touch you this time

1438
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,040
Move your hand

1439
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,280
Some more

1440
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,000
Enough

1441
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,320
No, that's enough

1442
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,200
You!

1443
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,240
Sorry

1444
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,480
What sorry?

1445
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,480
Saying sorry
after waking me up

1446
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,840
Hey, doggie

1447
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,640
You're so dead

1448
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,720
Brother, there are 26 hotels
between Toll 69 and Toll 70

1449
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,120
I've checked 20 of them
They haven't checked in there

1450
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,440
There are 6 hotels left

1451
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,780
Like Aruna Nivas, Dolphin Inn,
Hotel Crystal, and Navi Nivas

1452
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:37,447
I'm going to check there now

1453
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,480
Our guys are stationed
at both the tolls

1454
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,440
If the car crosses the toll,
I'll be informed immediately

1455
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,920
We can catch them by morning

1456
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,120
Okay, I'll be in
Mussoorie by morning, too

1457
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,640
We'll finish the deal
with both girls tomorrow

1458
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,400
Who asked you to
roam around in the dark?

1459
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,320
Why didn't you just go to sleep?

1460
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,280
Such a pain!

1461
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,244
I slipped
What can I do?

1462
01:21:56,269 --> 01:21:57,309
Lie down

1463
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,920
Go on, lie down

1464
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,680
You lie down

1465
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,880
I'm scared, you stay here

1466
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,640
Okay, I'll stay here
I'll sleep on the couch

1467
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,200
Okay, okay

1468
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,600
Move...a little bit

1469
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,680
-Thanks
-For what?

1470
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,000
For everything

1471
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,760
Your alarm?

1472
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,280
I'll kill you
Lie down!

1473
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,760
Just asked

1474
01:22:28,785 --> 01:22:29,905
Go to sleep

1475
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,160
You're the only person
I know who has an alarm to eat

1476
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,960
You must love your mum's cooking

1477
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,080
Can I tell you something?

1478
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,257
I don't have parents

1479
01:22:44,508 --> 01:22:45,308
What?

1480
01:22:45,388 --> 01:22:47,108
When I was young

1481
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,600
They died

1482
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,920
I grew up and still live in a hostel

1483
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,160
Know why this watch has an alarm?

1484
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:03,120
If I don't go to eat on time,
the food at the mess would be over

1485
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:07,760
If I tell him I am hungry,
the warden would cane me

1486
01:23:08,746 --> 01:23:11,026
I've been caned so many times,
you know

1487
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,160
Hence, the alarm

1488
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,080
Now it's become a habit

1489
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,800
In this big world full of people,
there is not a single soul

1490
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,600
To say
Hi How are you?

1491
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,240
Being alone is so painful, you know?

1492
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,720
But these two days I spent with you

1493
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,640
I smiled more than I have all my life

1494
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,200
Can I just be with you?

1495
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,200
Forever?

1496
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,320
You and I are one

1497
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,280
Good night

1498
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,760
Am I a little kid?

1499
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,480
Good night

1500
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,280
This is the day, man

1501
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,160
Madam, the gentleman
has vacated the room

1502
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,960
He asked me to give
this cover to you

1503
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,880
Hi The place to deliver
the car is here So I'm going

1504
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,760
You're returning to
Chennai tomorrow morning

1505
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,800
Why?

1506
01:25:09,825 --> 01:25:12,145
I'm here on work!
You should leave

1507
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:14,330
I don't know what kind
of place I'm headed to

1508
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:17,135
It's not appropriate
to take you with me

1509
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,000
I don't care
I'm going with you

1510
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,760
You brat!

1511
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,920
You wouldn't listen if I told you
So I had to leave this way

1512
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,400
There is a ticket
to Chennai in this cover

1513
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,320
I'll finish my job
and come to meet you

1514
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,680
Sorry
And thanks

1515
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,600
For everything

1516
01:25:40,185 --> 01:25:40,785
Careful

1517
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,600
"Even then don't go
leaving me...Aahaa..."

1518
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:03,680
"Even then don't go
leaving me...Aahaa..."

1519
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,360
Your son is kicking my tummy

1520
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,320
Billy!

1521
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,160
What are you doing here?

1522
01:26:37,841 --> 01:26:38,921
What's this?

1523
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,080
Where's the girl?

1524
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,440
Which girl?

1525
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,440
The girl was the package?

1526
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,320
Why didn't you tell me that before?

1527
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,320
You had switched off your phone

1528
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,840
How could we tell you?

1529
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,960
Where is the girl now?

1530
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,000
In her room

1531
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,480
Hello?

1532
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,040
I've seen him He is here with me

1533
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,520
Did you kill him?
Thieving little

1534
01:27:06,545 --> 01:27:07,105
No

1535
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,570
-Why?
-His phone was lost

1536
01:27:08,705 --> 01:27:10,825
Where is he?
-Right here In Mussoorie

1537
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,160
He wouldn't have come to Mussoorie
if he intended to cheat us

1538
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:16,345
He could have gone
off-course if he'd wanted to

1539
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,600
You have a point

1540
01:27:17,754 --> 01:27:19,194
Let me talk to him

1541
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,080
It's Dass

1542
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:22,960
Hello?
Bond!

1543
01:27:22,985 --> 01:27:25,945
-You never answered our calls
-My phone was lost

1544
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,210
You had called from a landline?

1545
01:27:27,313 --> 01:27:29,233
I was so worried,
I didn't answer any calls

1546
01:27:29,258 --> 01:27:30,458
Be quiet!

1547
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,160
'It'll disturb the patient'

1548
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,000
Bond, this is like a star hotel!

1549
01:27:35,295 --> 01:27:36,175
What are you doing?

1550
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,600
Need to put drops in the eye

1551
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:38,640
Dass?

1552
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:39,960
How do you give her food?

1553
01:27:39,985 --> 01:27:41,465
Through the tube Twice everyday

1554
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,508
Listen, Dass

1555
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,000
Looks like she's staring right at me
Isn't she like a doll?

1556
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,550
-Hello
-What is this?

1557
01:27:49,575 --> 01:27:50,575
Who are all these people?

1558
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,200
Why have you entered
with your slippers?

1559
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,960
Sister, you didn't tell them?

1560
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,720
You should shut up and do
the job you've been paid to do

1561
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,240
Pull some stunt and
you're done for

1562
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,600
Look, Bond

1563
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,160
If you finish this deal,
your sister is my sister

1564
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,120
Get it?

1565
01:28:11,145 --> 01:28:12,705
25 years!

1566
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,800
I've struggled my
way to where I am now

1567
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,400
I'm not going to let
you take it all away

1568
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,120
Got it?

1569
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,120
Hold on

1570
01:28:21,145 --> 01:28:21,665
Brother?

1571
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,800
Dass, you idiot!

1572
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,040
Where the hell are you?

1573
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,880
Network problem, brother
I did try No call went through

1574
01:28:27,905 --> 01:28:29,785
Where is the driver?
Did he call?

1575
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,810
Brother, the package is on the way

1576
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,520
-No complications?
-None whatsoever I'll handle it

1577
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,320
The package will reach you shortly
Don't worry

1578
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,920
I'm in Mussoorie now
Ask him to meet me at the monastery

1579
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,600
Bond, I know you're a good guy

1580
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:47,425
But you don't know
how bad these guys are

1581
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,800
Just hand over the package,
collect the money and come back

1582
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,600
Get to work Go on

1583
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,480
Give him a phone and
a bundle of cash Okay?

1584
01:29:01,953 --> 01:29:03,593
Bond, don't think too much

1585
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:21,120
-Brother, where's the bus to Chennai?
-It's just departed

1586
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,720
Excuse me

1587
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,280
Left me all alone Didn't you?

1588
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:05,200
Why have you come back now?

1589
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,400
Shakee

1590
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,720
-Look
-Don't say anything

1591
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,680
It's okay

1592
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:22,975
"Even then don't go
leaving me...Aahaa..."

1593
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,800
Never leave me again?

1594
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,360
Promise?

1595
01:30:33,072 --> 01:30:34,872
You've promised over
your own head

1596
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:36,617
Break it, and you'll
be in trouble

1597
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,120
Don't get down till I tell you

1598
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,960
Mr Bond?
Dass sent you?

1599
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:27,880
May I know why you
kidnapped the girl?

1600
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,760
If I'd turned my car around,
not a soul could have caught up

1601
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,080
But I didn't do that

1602
01:31:43,769 --> 01:31:46,169
You trusted me with a job

1603
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,160
I've finished it

1604
01:31:48,786 --> 01:31:49,826
I've taken my pay

1605
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:51,960
Our deal is over

1606
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,080
Now

1607
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,760
I'll offer you a deal

1608
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:02,600
Extra

1609
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,280
I want that girl

1610
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,520
Yesterday, if you'd touched the girl,
I'd have smashed you

1611
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,280
But today,
I'll kill you for it

1612
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,360
Wow!

1613
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,800
This place is so beautiful

1614
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,960
Quick

1615
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:57,880
Give it

1616
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,360
No! Wait

1617
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:58,960
Careful

1618
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,200
Nothing to worry

1619
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,880
Give me your shirt

1620
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,480
Pappu
Are you okay?

1621
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,640
Lift him up

1622
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,720
Give your shirt!

1623
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,160
-Are you okay?
-Take him to the hospital

1624
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,960
What's going on here?

1625
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,200
Go! Quick

1626
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,080
Get going

1627
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,320
You too, go away

1628
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,520
I don't need anybody

1629
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:32,531
This is great

1630
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,200
Let go

1631
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,120
Where will you go now?

1632
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,000
The game is just about to begin

1633
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,360
Just the beginning

1634
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,800
If you hit me

1635
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,160
Think it's over?

1636
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:27,800
I'm just an agent, like Dass

1637
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:34,040
This is not just about money
It's bigger than you think

1638
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:38,500
Do you know where she's going?
Durga Ghat

1639
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,280
Do you know who
asked for this girl?

1640
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,920
She's getting away
Get her

1641
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,400
DAKSHA BHAI!

1642
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,520
Give it

1643
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,040
He's getting away

1644
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,040
Let him go

1645
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,480
Don't aim for where he is

1646
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,720
Aim for where he is going to be

1647
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:27,840
Let him go

1648
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,080
Where are they now?

1649
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,440
I spoke to Pooran Singh
They should be here anytime

1650
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,760
He said that half an hour back
Call him

1651
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,240
The phone is ringing

1652
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,120
Who are you?

1653
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,400
Tell me, sir

1654
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,000
How did you get here?

1655
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:05,040
I am

1656
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,000
Welcome home
Help yourself to these sweets

1657
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,400
-Help yourself
-Thanks

1658
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:32,040
I thought they'd bash us up
But here's a welcoming ceremony!

1659
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,200
Pooran Singh was supposed to
deliver the girl Why are you here?

1660
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,880
Pooran Singh is your man?
I didn't know

1661
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,320
He touched the girl;
I hit him

1662
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,000
That's all

1663
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,080
So

1664
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,280
You're offering me 15 You
must have offered him a lot more, huh?

1665
01:39:53,736 --> 01:39:55,416
Why don't you pay me
the whole amount?

1666
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:57,881
I did deliver the girl
safely Right?

1667
01:39:57,977 --> 01:40:00,217
Do you know why we
had this girl brought here?

1668
01:40:03,034 --> 01:40:04,234
I don't need to know that

1669
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,440
All I need is money

1670
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,440
For how long have
you worked with Dass?

1671
01:40:09,224 --> 01:40:10,224
Let's say

1672
01:40:10,814 --> 01:40:12,494
About six

1673
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,880
I'll call Dass

1674
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:16,600
Hello

1675
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,280
Who do you think you are?
You hit him?

1676
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,360
I'm fine, brother
How is the missus?

1677
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,080
Are you mocking me?

1678
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:24,265
I have never been known
to sheath a dry sword

1679
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:26,456
I've got your salary, mind you
Oh yes, tell me!

1680
01:40:26,481 --> 01:40:28,961
You hit the agent and kidnap the girl
Think it's over?

1681
01:40:28,986 --> 01:40:31,306
That girl was Dhaksha Bhai
had asked for

1682
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,400
Yes, he's right here

1683
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,200
Just a minute - Give him the phone

1684
01:40:34,225 --> 01:40:35,905
-It's Dass
-I'll talk to him

1685
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,600
-Dass?
-Yes Brother?

1686
01:40:39,491 --> 01:40:40,891
The girl was delivered on time

1687
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:41,760
Good

1688
01:40:42,025 --> 01:40:44,705
The girl has reached?

1689
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,960
I'm sending the payment
through your man

1690
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,720
I'll collect it, brother

1691
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,200
Okay, brother

1692
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,800
Let me just talk to Bond

1693
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:00,440
Thanks

1694
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,400
Brother?

1695
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,320
Bond, what are you doing there?

1696
01:41:03,345 --> 01:41:04,945
How's the weather at home?

1697
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:07,120
Listen, that's a dangerous place

1698
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,600
You enter once,
you'll never come back out

1699
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,200
Really?
Super

1700
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,600
I am serious

1701
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,480
They've kidnapped a girl
from one corner of India to another

1702
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:20,457
I need to find out why
I won't leave until then

1703
01:41:20,482 --> 01:41:21,322
Okay?

1704
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:22,410
Listen to me

1705
01:41:22,546 --> 01:41:23,386
You're just a driver

1706
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:25,291
You've given me
directions until now

1707
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,600
Hereon, I make my own roads

1708
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,440
Just shut up and sit in the backseat

1709
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,960
I left my coat in the car
Ask him if it's safe?

1710
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,800
Think about your sister

1711
01:41:36,825 --> 01:41:37,585
Sister?

1712
01:41:38,385 --> 01:41:39,825
Are you threatening me?

1713
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,290
Go on

1714
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:43,170
Talk to her

1715
01:41:44,546 --> 01:41:45,266
Don't worry

1716
01:41:45,307 --> 01:41:46,267
Thank you, Doctor

1717
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,120
I'll take care

1718
01:41:47,145 --> 01:41:48,265
I moved her

1719
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,080
When?

1720
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,000
The fish is gone too?

1721
01:41:53,987 --> 01:41:57,147
There are 216 hospitals in Tamil Nadu

1722
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,040
Try tracking her down
and take care of her

1723
01:41:59,065 --> 01:42:01,025
Wouldn't a man who cares
as much for his sister

1724
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:02,730
Go all the way to protect her?

1725
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,280
Should anything happen to her

1726
01:42:06,961 --> 01:42:08,201
Just a count to ten

1727
01:42:08,674 --> 01:42:09,514
You'll be done for

1728
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,440
Hello Come here

1729
01:42:11,465 --> 01:42:12,345
Super, brother

1730
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:14,170
Convey my regards to your wife

1731
01:42:14,195 --> 01:42:16,475
It's an imported coat
Cost me 7,500 rupees

1732
01:42:16,649 --> 01:42:18,289
Get lost!

1733
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:19,920
I'm done talking

1734
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,520
So the girl doesn't
know she's been kidnapped?

1735
01:42:22,545 --> 01:42:23,345
No

1736
01:42:24,135 --> 01:42:26,735
According to her,
I'm here to drop the car off

1737
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,360
That's all

1738
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,200
One minute

1739
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,200
-It looks good, right?
-Yes

1740
01:42:33,506 --> 01:42:34,666
We're leaving?

1741
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:37,640
See

1742
01:42:38,948 --> 01:42:41,588
I would leave now,
but she'd want to come with me

1743
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,200
Having seen your welcome ceremony for her,
I suspect you'd want things to smooth

1744
01:42:47,423 --> 01:42:49,223
Do whatever you want with her

1745
01:42:49,248 --> 01:42:50,360
That isn't any of my concern

1746
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,960
But things would be a
lot easier if I stick around

1747
01:42:53,095 --> 01:42:57,335
Also, this is not a part of the original
package This will cost you extra

1748
01:42:57,864 --> 01:42:59,415
Pay me a big one per day

1749
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,280
I'll get it done in two days

1750
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,720
We know what we're doing Quiet

1751
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,240
Well, you

1752
01:43:06,335 --> 01:43:07,935
Are we leaving?

1753
01:43:08,906 --> 01:43:09,426
Yes

1754
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,160
We're here, we've dropped the car off

1755
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:13,189
Now, we're sorting out the payment

1756
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,480
If it's finished,
we'll leave

1757
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,280
You're our guests here

1758
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,080
There is a festival coming up

1759
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:23,040
Everything will be finished
in two days You must stay

1760
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:26,080
Ravi Show them their rooms

1761
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,800
What do they want with her?

1762
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:37,120
Maybe she has a rare blood
group Some organ of hers?

1763
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,640
What are you thinking?

1764
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,640
Do you have a brain?
Not a chance

1765
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,960
Maybe something about
your birth stars?

1766
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:48,960
Your future husband destined to rule?
Or something like that?

1767
01:43:48,985 --> 01:43:51,345
-Do you want to?
-So, it's not that either!

1768
01:43:51,905 --> 01:43:53,105
What is it about you

1769
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,160
You have short term memory loss?!

1770
01:43:55,185 --> 01:43:57,625
Do you forget everything
in fifteen minutes?

1771
01:43:57,832 --> 01:43:59,312
Why are you all smiles?

1772
01:44:01,056 --> 01:44:03,016
-Is the deal done?
-Of course

1773
01:44:03,041 --> 01:44:05,881
You got paid 15 million
just to deliver a car from Chennai?

1774
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:06,666
Yes

1775
01:44:07,486 --> 01:44:10,926
So it's not just the car
There must have been something in it?

1776
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:20,760
I won't ask you what it is,
but this is the last time

1777
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,000
Yesterday, you were something else
Today you're everything to me

1778
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,400
Want to give a kiss?

1779
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,520
Kiss me

1780
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,360
You've got vermillion on
your forehead What do we do?

1781
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,280
You slept here all night?

1782
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,920
Did something happen?

1783
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,080
Fool!

1784
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,640
Have you been here before?

1785
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,320
Where?

1786
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,200
North India

1787
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,440
Yeah right
Never even crossed North of our city

1788
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,840
What could it be?

1789
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,280
Maybe

1790
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,520
Saw that?

1791
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,720
Come here

1792
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,760
I got it for you

1793
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,600
Always in such a hurry
I'd have shown you anyway

1794
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:35,600
Isn't it nice?

1795
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,520
Yeah Very nice

1796
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,000

1799
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,880
-Where's Ravi?
-He's coming, brother

1800
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,240
Ask everyone to come

1801
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,960
I think it's their traditional attire

1802
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,480
Maybe their family attire?

1803
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,200
Your mother?

1804
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,120
My grandmother

1805
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,840
-How old is she?
-96 or 97

1806
01:46:41,921 --> 01:46:43,321
97?

1807
01:46:43,425 --> 01:46:44,545
Woah!

1808
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,640
Can I feed her?

1809
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,480
In our custom,
women are our Goddesses

1810
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,960
They are our leaders

1811
01:46:52,985 --> 01:46:54,585
Our decision makers

1812
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:57,130
It's called Rani Theni dynasty

1813
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,720
Granny has been our leader
for the past two generations

1814
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,520
After granny

1815
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,440
Are there only male
children in your family?

1816
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,720
There was a female child

1817
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,280
Not anymore

1818
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,160
She even smells like her

1819
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,880
What is she saying?

1820
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,440
She mistook you for someone else

1821
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:35,960
One minute Be right back

1822
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:40,200
So Uncle, is the job done?

1823
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,000
The bail has been rejected

1824
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,520
Everybody
Inside now You can eat later

1825
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,480
Go on

1826
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:04,280
Can't you hear us?

1827
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:05,960
Sorry

1828
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,160
Go

1829
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:08,800
Awesome gravy!

1830
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,000
Nice

1831
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,840
I hate a meal interrupted

1832
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:21,400
So you don't want to be heard!

1833
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,680
You're telling me NOW
that the parole was rejected?

1834
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:27,320
Idiot

1835
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,200
We've been planning for months

1836
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,040
Don't you know how
vital this parole is?

1837
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,680
They refuse to give parole
to death row convicts

1838
01:48:35,705 --> 01:48:37,985
That's not my problem!
Break into the prison then

1839
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,050
Break in, if you must
I need this done

1840
01:48:40,075 --> 01:48:41,315
While this girl is still here

1841
01:48:47,216 --> 01:48:49,056
Maybe we should try a bit harder

1842
01:48:49,222 --> 01:48:51,582
The court has rejected
our reason for parole

1843
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:52,730
Listen

1844
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,800
Apply for the parole now
We will get it

1845
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,160
Do you need a better reason?

1846
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,840
I've got all the info you asked for

1847
01:49:19,975 --> 01:49:22,615
There is a constant clash between
these two castes in Uttarakhand

1848
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:27,040
The lower caste people submitted
a petition to build a school

1849
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:30,120
Displeased, the higher caste people

1850
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:33,480
Butchered forty of
the lower caste in retaliation

1851
01:49:37,017 --> 01:49:38,297
What happened?

1852
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,400
The parole was rejected

1853
01:49:40,487 --> 01:49:46,407
Court refused to permit a death row
convict on parole to celebrate a festival

1854
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,240
They say it's not a valid reason

1855
01:49:49,485 --> 01:49:51,925
What is your reason for parole now?

1856
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:57,720
When did it happen?

1857
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:02,680
Open up

1858
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,120
The parole has been granted

1859
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,080
We'll leave in another two hours

1860
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:08,200
I'm at the prison now

1861
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:12,600
Who will lead our family after you?

1862
01:50:12,858 --> 01:50:17,578
A girl child was born into
our family after two generations

1863
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:23,920
She, too, is in the prison for trying
to preserve our family's honour

1864
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,280
The one who slaughtered Was a woman

1865
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,720
Called Gaggi Moi

1866
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:53,680
I don't have a choice, Mother

1867
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,400
Please understand

1868
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:08,920
I thought you said
the parole was rejected

1869
01:51:08,945 --> 01:51:09,705
How did we get it?

1870
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:11,570
It's Mother

1871
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,160
What about Mother?

1872
01:51:32,185 --> 01:51:33,705
She's passed away

1873
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,720
She was in a wheelchair all this time

1874
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,720
Now she'll hang from
the wall on a photograph

1875
01:51:40,745 --> 01:51:42,065
Why do you feel so sad?

1876
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:43,490
She wasn't your mother

1877
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,000
You shall not kill anyone!
They are all mine to kill

1878
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:12,415
Must bathe granny after
the meal, right?

1879
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:13,000
Yes

1880
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,480
If grandma looks at us-

1881
01:52:15,505 --> 01:52:16,785
What happened, grandma?

1882
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,960
Granny!

1883
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,720
Granny, what's happened?

1884
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:26,400
What have you done?

1885
01:52:26,425 --> 01:52:28,545
What have you done?

1886
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:31,730
I won't let you go

1887
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,320
-Phone call, brother
-Tell me

1888
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,720
He made us run around the
city hunting every hospital

1889
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,640
But he had just shifted
her to the floor above

1890
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,320
Just say the word

1891
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,600
I've got the entire
hospital surrounded

1892
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:57,920
Uncle

1893
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:01,000
How long can she be out on parole?

1894
01:54:01,025 --> 01:54:02,545
-Four hours
-Okay

1895
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,080
So

1896
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,320
The cops will bring our
sister from the prison

1897
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,920
By the prisoner's train,
straight to the graveyard

1898
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,920
How many cops will
accompany her in the train?

1899
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:12,840
Around 30

1900
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:17,440
So the four hours in the graveyard
is when we save our sister

1901
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:23,174
You had asked for that girl's
ID and passport It's ready

1902
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:23,719
What next?

1903
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:29,160
When all the issues die down, our sister
will fly abroad in the girl's passport

1904
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,960
All of you, got it?

1905
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,240
Did you get it?

1906
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,800
What is it, Mr Bond?

1907
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,040
James Bond?

1908
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,160
We've been planning
this for six months

1909
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,440
You just turned up yesterday

1910
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:04,240
You're still following
the route I mapped for you

1911
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,320
Somehow, you did one thing right

1912
01:55:11,936 --> 01:55:13,976
You brought us the girl on time

1913
01:55:14,001 --> 01:55:16,281
We're letting you go just for that

1914
01:55:16,401 --> 01:55:17,081
Go

1915
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,040
One second

1916
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:24,240
What did you want
to play the girl's lover?

1917
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,520
One hundred thousand a day Right?

1918
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,160
Do you believe me now?

1919
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,120
Is this true?

1920
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:49,280
Is he telling the truth?

1921
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,720
-I told you
-One minute

1922
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:57,480
You tell me

1923
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,200
So you weren't delivering the car?

1924
01:56:10,769 --> 01:56:11,969
You could have told me

1925
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,600
I don't have anyone

1926
01:56:15,765 --> 01:56:19,685
No mother or father
to grieve my death

1927
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,960
I thought I had one man

1928
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,840
Now I've lost that, too

1929
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:31,360
It's okay

1930
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:34,680
You can take me

1931
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:45,920
I know you'd do anything
for your sister

1932
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:55,320
But you don't know what
I'd be willing to do for you

1933
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:18,240
Start walking

1934
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,280
Sit here

1935
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,440
Your arm

1936
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,880
I need to make a call

1937
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,000
Last wish, huh?

1938
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,600
Give him your phone

1939
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,600
-Doctor
-Hello

1940
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:32,200
Nandini's brother speaking

1941
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:34,760
Tell me

1942
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,520
If you don't mind
if you near my sister

1943
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,320
I want to talk to my sister

1944
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,760
Please pass on the phone?

1945
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:48,800
Hello?

1946
01:58:48,825 --> 01:58:49,865
Talk to her

1947
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,360
Hi, how are you doing?

1948
01:58:54,385 --> 01:58:58,825
I was to return sooner,
but this trip took unexpected turns

1949
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:02,810
On my way here,
I saw this beautiful sunset in Agra

1950
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,520
I'll take you there
when everything is okay

1951
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,600
You'll definitely love it

1952
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:11,480
She loved it, too

1953
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:13,040
Shakee

1954
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,400
She is a lot like you

1955
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:18,840
Just like you,
I am all she has

1956
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,600
On the way here, two strangers
died in a motorcycle accident

1957
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:26,960
She was so disturbed

1958
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,000
Today, she is on her way to die

1959
01:59:31,112 --> 01:59:32,352
She knows it, too

1960
01:59:32,417 --> 01:59:33,457
She's doing it for me

1961
01:59:33,906 --> 01:59:34,826
I'm going

1962
01:59:36,697 --> 01:59:38,537
I'm going to try to save the girl

1963
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:43,120
I know you'll regain
consciousness someday

1964
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:47,000
When you open your eyes,
if I stand before you

1965
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:49,600
You'll find her by my side

1966
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,280
I'll introduce you both

1967
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:58,520
But when you open your eyes,
if I am not there

1968
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:01,680
Do understand

1969
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,360
That your brother tried
to save a girl like you

1970
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:08,840
And failed

1971
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:27,360
She can hear me talk

1972
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:28,720
Call the Chief Doctor
immediately, Nurse

1973
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,600
I can't believe it It's never
happened in this hospital before

1974
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:31,840
Call the doctor

1975
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,160
This is fantastic I never
thought Her eyes are watering!

1976
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,080
I can't believe it

1977
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,200
Stop Move away!

1978
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,520
Doctor, please come immediately
This is fantastic

1979
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,520
Come to the ward immediately

1980
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,040
How far is the graveyard from here?

1981
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:19,640
Sir, time is up

1982
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:20,680
Take her away

1983
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:59,760
I've asked the cop to kill this girl

1984
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,360
Do it yourself if he fails

1985
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:02,320
Okay, brother

1986
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:18,280
Run away, or they'll kill you

1987
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,040
Gadgi is trying to escape

1988
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,400
Don't shoot

1989
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,600
Catch her!

1990
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,080
"Come what may..."

1991
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:13,880
You won't leave me alone
here and go, right?

1992
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:18,800
"Let anything happens..."

1993
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:21,680
It's Gaggi, our enemy!

1994
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,960
How dare she come here
after killing our people?

1995
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,600
Kill her

1996
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:42,240
Boss! I've saved our family's legacy

1997
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:47,280
The townsfolk are on pursuit
You handle them

1998
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,800
Take Gaggi away

1999
02:05:58,840 --> 02:05:59,840
Gaggi, go inside

2000
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:00,440
Let go!

2001
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:02,720
Our plans will go to waste
if the townsfolk catch sight of you

2002
02:06:02,745 --> 02:06:03,585
Go inside, first!

2003
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:04,840
I said inside

2004
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,520
Why are we going back?
What's wrong?

2005
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,640
We can't run away from this

2006
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:11,360
We need to end it here

2007
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:23,520
Please

2008
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:25,080
Don't go outside

2009
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:28,400
Granny gave up her life for this
You'll ruin everything

2010
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,360
Wuss

2011
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:12,280
Catch her!

2012
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:16,280
Shoot!

2013
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,280
Bittu, what's happened to you?
Fire your gun

2014
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:27,000
Let me go!

2015
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,080
Go Faster

2016
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:41,640
-Be alert, guards
-Yes, sir!

2017
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:47,200
Come on!

2018
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,600
They said you looked like me

2019
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:40,160
You're ugly

2020
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:41,320
Give me the gun

2021
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:44,800
Gaggi tried to run from the cops
You stopped her

2022
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,440
She shot you

2023
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,600
And you shot her

2024
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,360
Give me some time

2025
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:55,280
Why? Is this not a
good time to die?

2026
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:57,440
How long?

2027
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,200
Ten seconds

2028
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,520
Come on, brother

2029
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:07,240
Go, "di"

2030
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:35,640
Fool

2031
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:50,920
Where are you going?

2032
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,240
Let her go

2033
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:56,760
It's all for her, right?

2034
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,520
Gaggi!

2035
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:02,920
Don't!

2036
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:17,880
Where do you think you're going?

2037
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,440
Dodo, can you fly?

2038
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:22,600
It's all for her, right?

2039
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:29,680
It's over

2040
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:41,600
What?

2041
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:43,360
Go straight

2042
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,040
Me? I should drive?

2043
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:48,480
Of course, you Go straight, 'di'

2044
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:49,240
Fast!

2045
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:53,000
Hit the brakes

2046
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:57,280
Can't you see I'm talking?

2047
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:58,960
Gadgi!

2048
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:10,760
What should I do?

2049
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:14,720
Reverse no, first gear

2050
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:15,720
Okay, sir!

2051
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:17,640
First gear Don't screw up!

2052
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:18,880
That's really easy, sir

2053
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:24,000
Superb!

2054
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:25,720
Did I do well?

2055
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:28,840
You did great

2056
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:37,960
I should have reversed this way
Why did I do it wrong?

2057
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,760
Normally, I don't make
the same mistake twice

2058
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:40,720
Hey, Dodo!

2059
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:44,280
Your mistake saved your life
Get down

2060
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:45,640
And my license?

2061
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:47,480
License

2062
02:12:47,505 --> 02:12:48,665
License?

2063
02:12:48,753 --> 02:12:50,033
I'll give your money back

2064
02:12:50,059 --> 02:12:51,099
Take this car

2065
02:12:51,226 --> 02:12:52,706
Take me, too

2066
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:54,600
Look at that face!

2067
02:12:54,625 --> 02:12:56,465
Ride on cattle instead

2068
02:12:56,529 --> 02:12:58,529
No brakes or gears in it

2069
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:31,920
Okay!

2070
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:34,480
Okay, at least tell me now

2071
02:13:34,505 --> 02:13:35,945
What's your name?

2072
02:13:40,553 --> 02:13:41,673
Yuck!

2073
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:43,280
Is that even a name?

2074
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:45,480
Want to see my license?

2075
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:46,960
Good for me

2084
02:13:47,305 --> 02:13:53,646
